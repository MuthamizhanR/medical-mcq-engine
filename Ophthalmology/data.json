They are also known as Purkinje reflexes or Purkinje\u2013Sanson images.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn aphakia, images 3 and 4 are absent, while in a mature cataract, image 4 is absent.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nImage 4, which is formed on the posterior surface of the lens, is inverted.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe visual axis is the line joining the fixation point (object), nodal point (centre of the lens), and the fovea.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nAngle alpha (\uf061) is the angle between the optical axis and visual axis at the nodal point.\nAngle lambda (\uf0b0 ) is the angle between the pupillary axis and the line of sight. It is the global tilt offset of the eye when it fixates on a specific target and is a response to the eccentric displaced position of the fovea from the geometrical center of the retina. (Option B)\nAngle kappa (\uf06b) is the angle between the visual axis and the pupillary line at the cornea. It is the only angle that can be measured and is of clinical significance. (Option C)\nPositive \uf06b is seen in pseudoexotropia\nNegative \uf06b is seen in pseudoesotropia\nAngle gamma (\uf067) is the angle between the optical axis and the fixation axis at the center of eyeball rotation. (Option D)\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nRefractive power (dioptre) = 1/Focal length in metres\nSo, for the given question, refractive power (D) = 1/0.75 = 1.33 D\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nIn the image, point A is the optic disc and point B is the fovea. The fovea is situated about 2 disc diameters (3\u20134 mm) away from the temporal margin of the optic disc.\nThe optic disc is an area of about 1.5 mm. There is a blind spot / physiological scotoma, corresponding to the optic disc.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nShortening of 2mm of the axial length of the eyeball will lead to 6D of hypermetropia.\nIn axial hypermetropia, 1mm shortening of the anteroposterior diameter of the eye results in 3 dioptres of hypermetropia. Therefore, 2-mm shortening will lead to 6D of hypermetropia.\nIn curvature hypermetropia, a 1mm increase in radius of curvature results in 6 dioptres of hypermetropia.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given figure is a Sturm's conoid. It represents a bundle of light rays formed by a regularly astigmatic surface. The image is clearest or least confusing as point D, the circle of least confusion.\nWhen light passes through a regularly astigmatic surface(surface with toric curvature), vertical and horizontal rays converge at different points.\nThe distance between the points of convergence (focus) of the vertical and horizontal rays is called the focal interval of strum. (distance between points B and F). The circle of least confusion/ circle of diffusion lies at the mid-point of this interval.\nF r the given Sturm's conoid,\nAt point A, a horizontal oval is formed because vertical rays converge more rapidly than horizontal rays.\nAt point B, vertical rays come to a focus, while horizontal rays are still converging; so, it will be a horizontal straight line.\nAt points C, D, and E, the vertical rays are diverging and horizontal rays are still converging.\n\nAt point D, the vertical rays have diverged as much as the horizontal rays have converged; so, we get a perfect circle called the circle of least confusion.\nAt point E, a vertical oval is formed.\nAt point F, a vertical straight line is formed\nAt point G and beyond, both rays are diverging, and we always get a vertical oval/prolate ellipse.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe Stiles\u2013Crawford effect refers to the greater sensitivity of the retina to perpendicular rays than the oblique rays. It is one of the natural mechanisms that decrease aberration in the eye. The rays of light that enter through the center of the pupil have higher sensitivity as compared to those entering from the periphery of the pupil.\nNatural mechanisms that decrease aberrations in the human eye:\nCutting-off of the peripheral rays by the iris\nThe high refractive index of the core of the nucleus of the lens than that of the peripheral cortex\nLow sensitivity of the peripheral retina\nStiles\u2013Crawford effect\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nPhotoreceptors are the first-order neurons in the visual pathway.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\n\nCones predominate in the foveal region, not the extrafoveal region.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nMuller cells are a type of glial cells found in the retina that help in the binding of the neuronal elements together. They do no take part in the neurosensory pathway of light.\nOther cells in the retina:\nMeissner's corpuscles: Tactile receptors localizing in the dermis between epidermal ridges, perceiving touch\nBasket cells: GABAergic interneurons found in the cerebellum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nRods and cones release glutamate (not acetylcholine) at their synapses.\nPhotoreceptors get hyperpolarized in response to stimulus, and hence, phototransduction is associated with hyperpolarization.\nAmacrine cells secrete at least eight types of neurotransmitters, including GABA, glycine, dopamine, acetylcholine, and indolamine, all of which function as inhibitory neurotransmitters.\nBipolar cells show both depolarization/hyperpolarization.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nMetarhodopsin II is responsible for phototransduction.\nIt activates transducin member of G proteins. This leads to the closure of Na+ channels and hyperpolarization, thereby inducing phototransduction (signal transduction in the retina).\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nOpsin combines with 11-cis-retinal to produce rhodopsin.\nOnly the retinal form of vitamin A is involved in the formation of the photopigment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nChromophore regeneration occurs in the retinal pigment epithelial cells. Phototransduction:\nRhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor found in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors.\n11-cis-retinal (a chromophore) is covalently bound to opsins via a lysine residue on one of the transmembrane domains.\nThe receptor is activated by photo-isomerization of prebound 11-cis-retinal t ALL-TRANS-retinal.\nActivation of the receptor causes binding and activation of the G protein, transducin, with signal transduction via cGMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in a decrease in the intracellular cGMP levels and closure of the cGMP-gated Na channels.\nThis causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell, which modulates neurotransmitter release at the synapse with bipolar cells.\nThis entire process triggered by the activation of rhodopsin is phototransduction, which occurs in the outer segment of photoreceptors and converts light energy into an electrical signal.\nChromophore regeneration:\nAll-trans retinAL is converted to all-trans-retinOL.\n\nAll-trans-retinOL gets transported by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) to the retinal pigment epithelial cells, where it is reconstituted into the 11-cis retinal isoform.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe parvocellular pathway gives signals for color vision, texture, shape, and fine details. LGB: lateral geniculate body\nThe interlaminar pathway gives signals for color vision to layers 2 and 3 of the visual cortex having clusters of cells called blobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nBlobs in the primary visual cortex are rich in the enzyme cytochrome oxidase.\nBlobs are sections of the visual cortex where groups of neurons that are sensitive to color assemble in cylindrical shapes. They are present in layers 2 and 3 of the visual cortex.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nK nio cells are involved in the transmission of color.\nThe koniocellular pathway is ventral to each parvocellular and magnocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). K cells are neurochemically and anatomically distinct from M and P cells. They contain calbindin protein, whereas M cells and P cells contain parvalbumin. K1,\nK4, and K6 receive ipsilateral retinal inputs, and K3 and K5 receive contralateral retinal inputs. K2 receives both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum for the human eye is 400\u2013700 nm. Theories of color vision:\nTrichromatic theory (Young\u2013Helmholtz theory) assumes that there are three types of color receptors. Each receptor is assumed to respond to all wavelengths, however, each has different spectral sensitivities.\nOpponent process theory, also known as the Hering theory, assumes three sets of receptor systems\u2014red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. Each one of these functions as an antagonistic pair (e.g., red light stimulates the red receptors and, at the same time, inhibits the green).\nEdwin Land's theory has three separate color systems (retinexes). Each is an analog to a black-and-white picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nIn deuteranomaly, the perception of green color is defective. It is the most common disorder of color vision.\nMonochromacy: Only one of the three primary colors (red, blue, or green) can be appreciated. Dichromacy: Two primary colors are appreciated. (anopia = absent).\nProtanopia: Red color is not perceived.\nDeuteranopia: Green color is not perceived.\nTritanopia: Blue color is not perceived.\nTrichromacy: All the three primary colors are appreciated, but one of them can be defective\n(anomaly = defective).\nProtanomaly: Red color perception is defective.\nDeuteranomaly: Green color perception is defective.\nTritanomaly: Blue color perception is defective.\nAchromatopsia: No color perception due to the absence of cones. It may also occur in the lesion of area V4 or V8 of the visual cortex.",
