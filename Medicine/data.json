Which of the following acid-base disorders is she likely to have?\nMetabolic acidosis\nMetabolic alkalosis\nRespiratory acidosis\nRespiratory alkalosis\n\n\nQuestion 23:\n\nIn the given acid-base nomogram diagram, areas marked A and D indicate which of the following conditions?\n\n\nChronic respiratory acidosis, acute metabolic alkalosis\nAcute Metabolic alkalosis, acute respiratory acidosis\nAcute respiratory acidosis, acute respiratory alkalosis\nAcute respiratory acidosis, acute metabolic alkalosis\n\n\nQuestion 24:\n\nThe arterial blood gas analysis findings of a patient are as follows: pH= 7.30, HCO3= 10 mEq/L, paCO2= 30 mmHg, which is suggestive of a partially compensated metabolic acidosis. What is the mechanism for the secondary disorder?\nHypoventilation causing decreased CO2 washout\nHyperventilation causing increased CO2 washout\nIncreased tubular reabsorption of HCO3-\nIncreased excretion of H+\n\n\nQuestion 25:\n\nThe arterial blood gas analysis of an unconscious man showed pH- 6.9, HCO3- 13 mEq/L, paCO2- 68 mmHg. The acid-base status of this patient is best described as:\nUncompensated metabolic acidosis\n\nUncompensated respiratory acidosis\nSimultaneous respiratory and metabolic acidosis\nRespiratory acidosis with partial renal compensation\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Key\n\n\n\nDetailed Explanations\n\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most effective extracellular buffer system at physiological pH is the bicarbonate buffer system.\nA molecule with a pKa close to the physiological pH (7.4) is considered an effective buffer. Although the pKa of HCO3- is relatively low (6.1), it makes up 92% of the plasma buffering.\nThis is often attributed to the enormous quantity of HCO3- present in the body and the ability of this system to accept protons and form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This further in the presence of carbonic anhydrase is converted to readily excretable H\u25a0O and CO2. It is therefore considered the most efficient extracellular buffering system in the body.\nHCO3- + H+\uf0b0\tH2CO3 \uf0b0\tH\u25a0O + CO2\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nFlexion of the wrist is not done just before drawing blood for ABG analysis.\nDuring arterial blood gas analysis, the ideal position for drawing arterial blood from the radial artery is to maintain the wrist in extension. This provides stability to the artery and prevents it from slipping away during the puncture. To draw blood for ABG analysis, the skin is pierced at a 45\u00b0 angle.\n\n\nAllen's test is done prior to radial cannulation to identify the adequacy of radial and ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand.\n\n\n\nThe syringe used to draw blood for ABG analysis is rinsed with heparin prior to the procedure. Prior to collecting blood, 0.1 ml heparin is drawn into the syringe and then flushed\nout. The residue that lubricates the inner wall of the syringe is sufficient to prevent the blood from clotting.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nMineralocorticoid deficiency does not cause metabolic alkalosis. Its excess causes metabolic alkalosis.\nCauses of metabolic alkalosis:\nLoss of hydrogen:\nGastrointestinal loss\nRemoval of gastric secretions - vomiting or nasogastric suction\nChloride-losing diarrhea\nGastrocolic fistula\nVillous adenoma\nAntacid therapy, particularly if combined with cation exchange resin\nRenal loss\nLoop or thiazide diuretics\nMineralocorticoid excess (primary aldosteronism, Cushing's, steroids, licorice)\nPosthypercapnic states\nHypercalcemia, including milk-alkali syndrome\nH+ movement into cells\n\nHypokalemia Exogenous Alkali:\nAdministration of NaHCO3, sodium citrate/gluconate/acetate/antacids\nMassive blood transfusion\nAntacids- Milk alkali syndrome Contraction alkalosis (loss of ECF volume):\nLoop or thiazide-type diuretics\nSweat losses in cystic fibrosis\nGastric losses in achlorhydria Miscellaneous:\nBartter's syndrome\nGitelman's syndrome\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe metabolic abnormality patients with bulimia nervosa are least likely to develop is metabolic acidosis. Chronic vomiting, as seen in bulimia nervosa leads to metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis.\nConditions associated with chronic vomiting lead to hypochloremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nMetabolic alkalosis is associated with potassium depletion, not hyperkalemia.\nWhile hypercalcemia can be a cause of metabolic alkalosis, alkalosis itself can cause a decrease in ionized calcium. The patients can present with tetany and show signs of hypocalcemia, i.e., Trousseau sign and Chvostek's sign.\nConn's syndrome is primary hyperaldosteronism that leads to sodium reabsorption in exchange for hydrogen in the collecting ducts. This causes hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hydrogen loss in urine and may lead to metabolic alkalosis.\nRenin-secreting tumors also lead to an increase in aldosterone levels leading to alkalosis. Causes of metabolic alkalosis:\nLoss of hydrogen:\nGastrointestinal loss\nRemoval of gastric secretions- vomiting or nasogastric suction\nChloride-losing diarrhea\nGastrocolic fistula\n\nVillous adenoma\nAntacid therapy, particularly if combined with cation exchange resin\nRenal loss\nLoop or thiazide diuretics\nMineralocorticoid excess (primary aldosteronism, Cushing's, steroids, licorice)\nPosthypercapnic states\nHypercalcemia, including the milk-alkali syndrome\n\nH+ movement into cells\nHypokalemia Exogenous Alkali:\nAdministration of NaHCO3, sodium citrate/gluconate/acetate/antacids\nMassive blood transfusion\nAntacids- Milk alkali syndrome Contraction alkalosis (loss of ECF volume):\nLoop or thiazide-type diuretics\nSweat losses in cystic fibrosis\nGastric losses in achlorhydria Miscellaneous:\nBartter's syndrome\nGitelman's syndrome\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nAmong the given options, high pH (7.55), high HCO3- (30 mEq/L), and high pCO2 (48 mmHg) is suggestive of metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis, as a result of compensatory hypoventilation.\nMultiple episodes of vomiting result in loss of acids from the body and thus increases the pH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe underlying disorder in this patient is metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis.\nInterpretation of the ABG:\nStep 1: A pH of 7.55 indicates alkalosis.\nStep 2: Plasma HCO3- is 40 mEq/L, which in the presence of a high pH indicates metabolic alkalosis.\nStep 3: pCO2 is 54 mmHg indicating respiratory acidosis. The increase in pCO2 along with the increase in pH suggests that this is a compensatory response.\nStep 4: Assessing the compensatory response:\nOn average, the pCO2 rises 0.75 mmHg for every 1.0 mEq/L increment in the plasma HCO3-\nIn the above scenario, the plasma HCO3- concentration is increased to 40 mEq/L (The average normal value is considered as 24 mEq/L)\nThus, the HCO3- elevation is 40 \u2013 24 = 16 mEq/L Therefore, pCO2 elevation should be 0.75 \u00d7 16 = 12 mmHg\nNow, considering that the average value of normal pCO2 is 40 mmHg, the estimated pCO2 measured should be 40 + 12= 52 mmHg.\nAs pCO2 is higher than the expected estimate, it is a case of metabolic alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe patient has low pH and decreased levels of bicarbonate which is indicative of metabolic acidosis. Bicarbonate reabsorption is increased in renal handling of metabolic acidosis.\nIn response to metabolic acidosis, acidification of urine occurs by the following compensatory mechanisms:\nThe proximal tubule reabsorbs all the filtered HCO3- (as any loss of HCO3- is equal to the addition of an equimolar amount of H+).\n\nThe collecting duct excretes the daily H+ load (loss of H+ is equal to the addition of an equimolar amount of HCO3-) primarily in the form of urinary ammonia.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe anion gap is the difference between measured cations and measured anions and is estimated as:\nAnion gap = [Na+] \u2013 ([Cl-] + [HCO3-])\nSubstituting the given values, AG is 22 mmol/L. Normal AG is 6 to 12 mmol/L with an average of 10 mmol/L.\nThe concentrations of anions and cations in plasma must be equal to maintain electrical neutrality. Therefore, there is no real \u201canion gap\u201d in the plasma.\nHowever, only certain cations and anions are routinely measured in the clinical laboratory. The cation normally measured is Na+, and the anions are usually Cl\uf02d and HCO3\uf02d. The value of plasma potassium is omitted from the calculation of the anion gap.\nUsually, the unmeasured anions exceed the unmeasured cations.\nThe anion gap will increase if unmeasured anions rise or if unmeasured cations fall.\nThe unmeasured anions include albumin, phosphate, sulfate, and other organic anions. The unmeasured cations include calcium, magnesium, and potassium.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe anion gap is increased in ketoacidosis. The ketone bodies act as unmeasured anions and increase the anion gap.\nThe anion gap is calculated as:\nAG = (Na+) \u2013 [(Cl-) + (HCO3-)]\nThe normal anion gap is 6 - 12 mEq/L (optimally &lt;10 mEq/L).\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nRenal tubular acidosis causes normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, not high anion gap acidosis.\nNormally, in the serum, the total number of cations is equal to the total number of anions. But, a few of the anionic proteins (e.g., albumin), phosphates, sulfates, and organic anions are not measured and this is called an anion gap. It is the difference between measured cations and measured anions and is estimated as:\nPlasma anion gap = [Na+] \uf02d([Cl-]+[HCO3-])\nThe normal anion gap ranges between 6-12 mEq/L.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nMetabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap is a feature of renal tubular acidosis.\nRenal tubular acidosis is a form of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis which occurs when the renal damage primarily affects tubular function without much effect on glomerular function. The bicarbonate loss leading to acidosis is mirrored by an increase in chloride concentration. Hence the unmeasured anions are unaffected and thus, the anion gap remains within normal limits.\nThe result is a decrease in H+ excretion which is greater than that can be explained by any change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, if the GFR is significantly depressed eg., renal failure, the retention of fixed acids leads to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nMetformin toxicity is associated with type B lactic acidosis.\nLactic acidosis is defined as an increase in plasma lactate levels. The various types of lactic acidosis are:\nD-lactic acidosis is an unusual form of metabolic acidosis. It occurs due to the formation of D-lactate by gut bacteria. It occurs in patients with:\nShort bowel syndrome\nPost-jejunoileal bypass\nIntestinal obstruction.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe probable diagnosis is a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) with metabolic alkalosis. Interpretation of the ABG:\nStep 1: The pH being 7.4 is within normal limits.\n\nStep 2: Plasma HCO3- is 23 mEq/L and again is within normal limits.\nAt this juncture, we have ruled out options B and C as this particular clinical scenario is not suggestive of a simple acid-base disorder.\nStep 3: Calculating the Anion gap:\nAnion gap = [Na+] \u2013 ([Cl-] + [HCO3-])\n= 145-(100+23)\n= 22 mEq/L\nThe presence of a high anion gap indicates that there's indeed an acid-base disorder, thus ruling out option A.\nA high anion gap indicates metabolic acidosis. However, HCO3- levels within normal limits suggest that there is also coexisting metabolic alkalosis in this patient.\nThis can be confirmed by calculating the delta gap. Delta gap = \uf044AG - \uf044HCO3-\nIn this scenario: Delta gap = (22-10) - (24-23) = 11 mEq/L\nDelta gap is &gt; +6 suggesting the presence of metabolic alkalosis along with HAGMA.\nIf the delta gap is significantly positive (&gt;+6), metabolic alkalosis is present because the rise in the anion gap is more than the fall in bicarbonate. If the delta gap is significantly negative (&lt;6) then hyperchloremic acidosis is usually present because a rise in the anion gap is less than a fall in bicarbonate.\nAlternatively, this can be confirmed by calculating the delta ratio. Delta ratio = the increase in Anion Gap / the decrease in HCO3-\nIt is used in the presence of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA), to check it is a \u2018pure\u2019 HAGMA or if there is coexistant normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) or metabolic alkalosis.\nDelta ratio values:\n1-2 indicates HAGMA\n&lt; 1 indicates NAGMA + HAGMA\n&gt; 2 indicates HAGMA + Metabolic alkalosis In this scenario,\nDelta ratio = 12/1 = 12\nThus, the acid-base disorder for the above scenario is HAGMA with metabolic alkalosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. This leads to a decrease in serum albumin which is an unmeasured anion.\n\nAlbumin at physiological pH is the major contributor to the unmeasured anions of the body. Unmeasured anions consume bicarbonate in the body and reduce its levels. This leads to an increase in the anion gap. Therefore, when these unmeasured anions are reduced the anion gap also reduces due to decreased consumption of the bicarbonate.\nNephrotic syndrome causes hypoalbuminemia and thus patients have a reduced anion gap. A fall in serum albumin by 1 g/dL from the normal value (4.5 g/dL) decreases the anion gap by 2.5 mEq/L.\nDecreased anion gap (&lt;6 mEq/L) is seen in:\nIncrease in unmeasured cations\nAn addition of abnormal cations to the blood, such as:\nLithium (lithium intoxication)\nCationic immunoglobulins (plasma cell dyscrasias)\nReduction in the plasma anion albumin concentration (nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, or malabsorption)\nBromide intoxication\nHyperviscosity and severe hyperlipidemia, which can lead to an underestimation of sodium and chloride concentrations.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nIn renal failure, there is a loss of kidney function due to the damage affecting glomeruli and tubules. This leads to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe underlying acid-base disorder in this patient is metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.\nInterpretation of the ABG:\nStep 1: A pH of 7.1 signifies acidosis.\nStep 2: Plasma HCO3- is 6 mEq/L, along with a low pH it signifies metabolic acidosis.\nStep 3: pCO2 is 16 mmHg indicating respiratory alkalosis. The decrease in pCO2 along with the decrease in pH suggests that this is a compensatory response.\nStep 4: The expected compensatory decrease in pCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula\n(Expected PCO2= {[1.5 x HCO3-] +8} \u00b1 2).\nExpected PCO2 = {[1.5 x 6] +8} \u00b1 2 = 15 to 19 mmHg\nA pCO2 level of 16 mmHg falls within the range given above. Hence, metabolic acidosis is associated with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.\n\n(pCO2 values above or below 15 - 19 mmHg would indicate mixed acid-base disorders) Alternatively:\nThe other method to calculate the expected compensation is a 1.2 mmHg decrease in pCO2 for every 1 mmol/L decrease in bicarbonate.\nThe decrease in bicarbonate is 24 - 6 = 18 mEq/L Decrease in pCO2 is 18 x 1.2 = 22\nExpected pCO2 = 40 - 22 = 18 mmHg (roughly = 16 mmHg since the standard values are approximations)\nThis method also indicates primary metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. However, Winter's formula is more accurate.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe probable reason for the patient's presenting symptoms is respiratory acidosis.\nAsthma attack leads to the narrowing of respiratory passages. This leads to reduced O2 inhalation and reduced CO2 exhalation contributing to the rise of pCO2 in the blood, thereby\ncausing respiratory acidosis. Causes of respiratory acidosis:\nCentral:\nDrugs (anesthetics, morphine, sedatives)\nStroke\nInfection\nAirway:\nObstruction\nAsthma\nLung parenchyma:\nEmphysema\nPneumoconiosis\nBronchitis\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome\nBarotrauma\nNeuromuscular:\nPoliomyelitis\nKyphoscoliosis\nMyasthenia\n\nMuscular dystrophies\nMiscellaneous:\nObesity\nHypoventilation\nPermissive hypercapnia.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe underlying acid-base disorder is respiratory acidosis. Interpretation of the ABG:\nStep 1: A pH of 7.24 signifies acidosis.\nStep 2: A plasma HCO3- is 27 mEq/L is within normal limits. This is very likely to be due to compensation as it does not reflect the direction of the pH change.\nStep 3: A pCO2 of 60 mmHg along with an acidotic pH signifies respiratory acidosis.\nStep 4: The expected compensatory increase in HCO3- can be calculated using the following formula:\nIncrease in HCO3- = 0.4 \u0161 \uf044 PaCO2 (as COPD is a chronic condition and the presentation of the patient is not acute)\nThus, the increase in HCO3- = 0.4 x (60-40) = 8 mEq/L Therefore expected HCO3- is 24 + 8 = 32 mEq/L.\nThe actual HCO3- measured is 27 mEq/L (which is less than the expected value) indicating that there could be a component of metabolic acidosis also.\nBut, the predominant disorder is respiratory acidosis and thus it is the best answer.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute severe asthma. The acid-base disorder is respiratory acidosis, partially compensated.\nInterpretation of the ABG:\nStep 1: pH is decreased. This signifies acidosis. In acidosis, either pCO2 is increased or plasma HCO3- is decreased.\nStep 2: In this case, pCO2 is increased by 30 mmHg. This signifies respiratory acidosis.\nStep 3: Plasma HCO3- is increased by 26-24 = 2 mEq/L. This signifies compensation is taking place.\nIn acute conditions, for every 10mmHg rise in pCO2 expected rise in plasma HCO3- is 1mEq/L. In this case, pCO2 has risen by 30 mmHg, so the expected rise in HCO3- is 3 mEq/L.\n\nHowever, plasma HCO3- has risen only by 2 mEq/L, which implies compensation is only partial.",
