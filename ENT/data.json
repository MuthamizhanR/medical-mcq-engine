It is also called the auricular cartilage.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nI cisura terminalis cannot be used to harvest cartilage as it is devoid of cartilage.\nIt is the part of the pinna between the tragus and the crus of helix. Being devoid of cartilage, the incision for endaural approach for ear surgery can be made here.\nThe lobule is also devoid of cartilage. Hence, it is the safest site for piercing. The parts of the pinna are:\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe skin over the pinna is loosely adherent on the medial or cranial side. Hence, it is pinchable. The skin is firmly adherent to the perichondrium on the lateral side and is non-pinchable.\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe length of the external auditory canal is about 24 mm.\nIt extends from the bottom of the concha to the tympanic membrane. It has two parts:\nOuter cartilaginous part - 8mm\nInner bony part- 16mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe pinna has to be pulled upwards, backwards and laterally to visualise the tympanic membrane. This is done to bring the bony and cartilaginous parts of the external auditory canal in alignment.\nThe inner bony part is directed downwards, forwards, and medially.\nThe outer cartilaginous part is directed upwards, backwards, and medially.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe outer 1/3rd is cartilaginous (8mm) and the inner 2/3rd is bony (16mm) in the external auditory canal.\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nFissures of Santorini are the two deficiencies in the cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal. They provide a pathway for the spread of parotid or superficial mastoid infections to the canal or vice versa.\nThe bony canal also has a deficiency called the foramen of Huschke which acts as a pathway for the spread of infections and tumours to the deep lobe of the parotid.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nFuruncles (staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles) are seen only in the outer one-third of the canal since hair is confined to the outer canal.\nSkin is also very tightly adherent to the cartilage and hence furuncles are extremely painful.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nCeruminous glands are modified apocrine sweat glands. They open into hair follicles &amp;\nparticipate in wax production.\nApocrine glands release their products by decapitation. It is a process by which membrane-bound cytoplasm from the apical surface of the cells buds off into the lumen of the duct and is secreted.\nSome apocrine glands have specific names. Those on the eyelids are referred to as Moll\u2019s glands, and those on the external auditory meatus are termed ceruminous glands.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe isthmus is the narrowest part of the external auditory canal (EAC).\nEAC measures about 24 mm long, cartilaginous part forms the outer one-third (8 mm) and bony part forms two-third (16 mm) of the canal. Isthmus is situated 6 mm lateral to the tympanic membrane in the bony part of the EAC. Foreign bodies that go beyond the isthmus are difficult to remove and are called impacted.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe normal tympanic membrane is pearly grey in color. It is thin and semitranslucent.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nPeripheral parts are more mobile than the central part where the handle of the malleus is attached The tympanic membrane develops from all three germinal layers. It has 3 layers \u2013\nOuter epithelial layer from ectoderm\nMiddle fibrous layer from mesoderm\nInner mucosal layer endoderm.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\n\nThe tympanic membrane has a thickness of 0.1mm. The dimensions of the tympanic membrane are\nLength: 9-10mm\nWidth: 8-9mm\nArea: 90 mm2\nSubtends an angle of 55\u00b0 with horizontal\nThe medial (inner) surface is convex and the lateral surface is concave. The most depressed part of its concavity is called the umbo, to which the tip of the malleus is attached.\nImage: Right tympanic membrane\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nPars flaccida is also known as Shrapnell\u2019s membrane.\nPars flaccida is situated above the lateral process of malleus between the notch of Rivinus and the anterior and posterior mallear folds.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nA bright cone of light can be seen radiating from the tip of malleus (umbo) to the periphery in the anteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane.",
