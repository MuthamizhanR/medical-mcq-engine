Which of the following drugs is not contraindicated in his condition?\nCotrimoxazole\nProguanil\nNalidixic acid\nCeftriaxone\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Key\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Explanations\nSolution to Question 1:\nNoradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine act through a bundle of seven alpha-helicase trans-membrane receptors which are the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nG proteins act as inhibitory and excitatory because of differences in the alpha subunit.\nExcitatory - Gs and Gq\nInhibitory - Gi\nIn the resting-state:\nG protein is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. It forms a complex with G-protein-coupled receptors at the intracellular domain. The extracellular domain of GPCR has the binding domain for hormones. G protein subunits do not directly bind them.\nThe alpha subunit is bound to GDP.\nBinding of ligand results in activation of GPCR, following which:\n\nAlpha subunit undergoes a conformational change\nRelease of GDP and binding of GTP occur\nGTP bound alpha subunit dissociates from beta-gamma subunit\nBoth alpha subunit and beta-gamma subunit bind to and regulate effectors only when they are eparated.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nAngiotensin 1 receptor acts via Ca2+ channels. It does not act through second messengers via the K+ channel.\nG-protein coupled receptors activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels and increase the permeability of the potassium ions causing hyperpolarisation of the cell. They are called G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs). These receptors include:\nM2 muscarinic\nA1 adenosine\n\uf0b0 2 adrenergic\nD2 dopamine\n5HT1 serotonin\nSomatostatin receptors.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nMuscarinic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors among the given options. M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 are the muscarinic Ach receptors.\n\nM1 and M3 act through Gq protein and activate IP3/DAG causing increased cytosolic calcium.\nM2 and M4 act through Gi protein and inhibit adenylyl cyclase causing increased potassium conductance.\n\n\n\nNicotinic receptors and GABA-A are examples of ion channel coupled receptors.\n\n\nInsulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nNicotinic cholinergic receptors (both Nm and Nn) are of ligand-gated ion channel type.\nThe binding of ligand alters the permeability of ion channels directly and brings about biological action.\n\n\nMuscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, and opioid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nInsulin receptors belong to the class of trans-membrane enzyme-linked receptors.\nTransmembrane enzyme-linked receptors consist of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain. It is connected to an intracellular subunit having enzymatic property through a single transmembrane helical peptide chain. The enzyme on the cytosolic side is usually a protein kinase (tyrosine) or membrane-bound GC (guanylyl cyclase).\nPhysiological ligands for transmembrane enzyme-linked receptors are mostly growth factors and chemokines. Other receptors belonging to this class include:\nReceptor tyrosine kinases - Growth factors (PDGF, EGF, VEGF); insulin\nMembrane-bound GC - Natriuretic peptide\nReceptor serine-threonine kinases - TGF-\uf062\nThyroid hormones, vitamin D, and steroids act via intracellular receptors.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nGuanylyl cyclase is an enzyme that converts GTP to cGMP. It is not a second messenger. Second messengers are:\nDiacylglycerol\nInositol triphosphate\nCyclic AMP\nCyclic GMP\nCalcium\n\nNitric oxide\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe receptor in the given image uses tyrosine kinase signaling. Insulin acts through this receptor to exert its functions.\nOther hormones acting via tyrosine kinase signaling:\nGrowth hormone\nGrowth factors like VEGF, PDGF, FGF, NGF\nProlactin\nLeptin\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nNesiritide is recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide. Natriuretic peptide receptors are transmembrane ligand-gated guanylyl cyclase receptors.\nNatriuretic peptides:\nAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP): released from atrial storage granules in response to an increase in intravascular volume. It decreases blood pressure.\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP): released from ventricular tissue in response to volume overload. Along with a decrease in blood pressure, it is known to reduce cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.\nC- type natriuretic peptide (CNP): synthesized in the brain and endothelial tissues and function to stimulate long bone growth.\nANP and BNP act on the NPR-A receptor. CNP acts on the NPR-B receptor.\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nJAK/STAT is a signal transducer for transmembrane receptors lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity. Interleukin and other cytokines act through such receptors.\nOn binding of the ligand to such receptors:\nReceptor dimerization occur\nIncrease in affinity for cytosolic JAK (Janus kinase)\nActivation of JAK results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the receptor\n\nBinding of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT\nSTAT dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, resulting in a biological response\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nAdrenaline and histamine are physiological antagonists.\nAdrenaline and histamine act on bronchial muscles. Histamine acts on H1 receptors and produces bronchoconstriction. Adrenaline acts on \uf0622 receptors and produces bronchodilation. Two drugs acting on different receptors and resulting in opposite responses means having pharmacological effects in the opposite direction. This is called physiological antagonism or functional antagonism.\nOption B: Chemical antagonism refers to a reaction between two chemicals to neutralize their effects, such as is seen with chelation therapy.\nOption C: Competitive antagonism is a type of receptor antagonism that occurs when the agonist and antagonist compete for the same binding site on the receptor.\nOption D: In uncompetitive inhibition, inhibitors form a complex with an intermediate complex of the substrate and transporter. This inhibits subsequent translocation.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nNon-competitive inhibitors cause a decrease in Vmax. In non-competitive inhibition:\nThe inhibitor binds to the adjacent site and not the catalytic site of the enzyme\nThe catalytic property of the enzyme is reduced and hence Vmax is decreased\n\nThe affinity of the enzyme is not altered and hence Km is unaltered\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nIn competitive antagonism, the drug and the antagonist compete to bind to the same site of the receptor.\nAgonists if present in high concentration, can displace the antagonists from the active site and overcome the competitive antagonism completely.\nThe dose-response curve in the case of competitive antagonism shifts to the right.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn the above image, drug B is a competitive antagonist.\nIn competitive antagonism, the DRC is shifted to the right whereas in non-competitive antagonism the DRC is flattened.\nThus in the above image Drug B is the Competitive antagonist while drug C is the non-competitive antagonist.\nPotency:\nIt is defined as the amount of drug needed to produce a given response.\nA highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations and vice-versa.\nThe more the curve is on the left in a dose-response curve (DRC), the greater is its potency.\nThus, in the above image, the potency is drug A &gt; drug C &gt; drug B. Efficacy:\nIt is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug.\n\nIt expresses the effect produced by the receptors when bound by a certain drug.\nIn the log dose-response curve, the perpendicular height represents the drug efficacy.\nThus, in the above image, the efficacy is drug A = drug B &gt; drug C.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nInverse agonists bind to the receptor and cause an action opposite to that of an agonist. The ability of the drug to bind with a receptor is called affinity.\nThe capacity of a drug to induce a functional change in the receptor is called intrinsic activity or efficacy.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nAripiprazole is a D2 receptor partial agonist. Partial agonists have submaximal or low intrinsic activity and high affinity.\nPartial agonists can behave as an antagonist in the presence of an agonist. Partial agonists block the binding of the agonist to the receptor thereby inhibiting a complete response.\nAripiprazole has lower activity than dopamine at D2 receptors. By occupying and blocking the action of dopamine on D2 receptors, it acts similar to an antagonist. It is used in conditions like schizophrenia where dopamine antagonist activity is required.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe parallel rightward shift of the agonist dose-response curve (DRC) is seen with competitive antagonism.\nIncreasing the dose of the agonist can result in the same maximal response. In non-competitive antagonism, there will be flattening of the agonist DRC.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nDrug A has the highest potency. Potency:\nIt is defined as the amount of drug needed to produce a given response. A highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations and vice-versa.\nThe more the curve is on the left in a dose-response curve (DRC), the greater is its potency.\nThus, in the above image, the potency is Drug A &gt;Drug B&gt; Drug C. Efficacy:\nIt is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug. It reflects the capacity of the drug to activate a receptor and produce the response.\nIn the log dose-response curve, the perpendicular height represents the drug efficacy.\nThus, in the above image, the efficacy is Drug A = Drug B &gt; Drug C.\nDrugs having a similar pharmacological effect can have different efficacies e.g furosemide and metolazone are both diuretics but furosemide has greater efficacy than metolazone.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe more the curve is on the left in a dose-response curve (DRC), the greater is its potency. Hence, Drug B is the most potent.\nPotency:\nIt is defined as the amount of drug needed to produce a given response.\nA highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations and vice-versa.\n\nIn the above image, the potency is Drug B&gt; Drug A &gt; Drug C &gt; Drug D. Efficacy:\nIt is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug. It reflects the capacity of the drug to activate a receptor and produce the response.\nIn the log dose-response curve, the perpendicular height represents the drug efficacy.\nThus, in the above image, the efficacy is Drug A = Drug C =Drug D &gt; Drug B.\nDrugs having a similar pharmacological effect can have different efficacies e.g furosemide and metolazone are both diuretics but furosemide has greater efficacy than metolazone.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nED50 is a measure of the drug potency, not efficacy.\nPotency refers to the amount of the drug required to produce a certain response. The x coordinates (dose axis) on the log dose-response curve (DRC) of a drug represent the potency of the drug. A right shift in the DRC indicates a lower potency and vice versa.\n\n\nPotency\nIt is defined as the amount of drug needed to produce a given response.\nA highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations and vice-versa.\nThe efficacy of a drug is a more decisive factor in the choice of a drug in the clinical setting\nThe more the curve shifts towards the left in a dose-response curve (DRC), the greater is it potency.\nThus, in the above image, Drug A is more potent. The potency is Drug A &gt; Drug B &gt; Drug C &gt; Drug D.\n\n\n\nEfficacy\nIt is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug.\nIt expresses the effect produced by the receptors when bound by a certain drug.\nIt is mainly a factor in choosing the dose of a drug.\nIn the log dose-response curve, the perpendicular height represents the drug efficacy.\nThus, in the above image, efficacy is Drug A &gt;B &gt; C &gt; D.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nVitamins and essential metals show a U-shaped dose-response curve.\nAt a low dose, adverse effects are observed because there is a deficiency of these nutrients to maintain homeostasis. As dose increases, homeostasis is achieved, and the bottom of the\nU-shaped dose-response curve is reached. As the dose increases to surpass the amount required to maintain homeostasis, toxicity can ensue.\nThus, adverse effects are seen at both low and high doses.\n\n\n\n\nHockey stick-shaped dose-response curve for toxicants that are also metabolic by-products.\n\n\n\nInverted U-shaped dose-response curve for ligands that downregulate their receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe area between the dotted lines in the graph shows the therapeutic window. It is the range of steady-state concentrations of a drug that provides therapeutic efficacy with minimal toxicity.\nThe therapeutic index (TI) describes a relationship between the doses of a drug that causes lethal or toxic effects with the dose that causes therapeutic effects. It is also called the therapeutic ratio.\nMathematically, you can calculate TI by following way:\nTherapeutic Index = LD50/ED50 (or) Therapeutic Index = TD50/ED50 Where,\nLD50 (Median Lethal dose) is the minimum amount of drug that causes adverse effects in 50% of the population. LD50 could also be replaced with Toxic dose (TD50).\nED50 (Median Effective dose) is the quantity of a drug that can produce desired therapeutic effects in 50% of the population.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nTherapeutic index is used to assess the safety of the drug administered. Therapeutic index = TD50/ED50\nTD50 (Median toxic dose) = Dose required to produce a toxic effect in 50% of animals tested.\nED50 (Median effect dose) = Dose required to produce a therapeutic effect in 50% of the individuals.\nOption B: Efficacy is defined as the maximum effect produced by the drug. It expresses the effect produced by the receptors when bound by a certain drug.\n\nOption C: Potency refers to the concentration (EC50) or dose (ED50) required to produce 50% of maximum effect where EC50 is the concentration of agonist resulting in a half-maximal response.\nOption D: Median toxic dose is the dose required to produce a toxic effect in 50% of animals tested. Lethal dose is the dose required to kill 50% of animals tested.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 24:\nTherapeutic index is calculated with the following equation = LD50/ED50. Therapeutic index is used to assess the safety of the drug administered.\nLD50 (median lethal dose) refers to the dose of the drug at which 50% of the experimental animals die. Larger the LD50, the safer the drug. In humans, TD50 is considered. TD50 refers to the dose of the drug that causes a toxic response in 50% of the population.\nED50 (median effective dose) refers to the dose of the drug at which 50% of the experimental animals show the specific or desired effect\nClinically, the therapeutic range bound by the dose that produces the minimal necessary therapeutic effect and the dose that produces the maximal acceptable adverse effect is more relevant.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe therapeutic index is 4. In the above graph,\nMedian lethal dose (LD50) = 400 Median effective dose (ED50) = 100\n\nTherapeutic index (TI) = LD50/ED50. Hence,\nTherapeutic index (TI ) = 400/100 = 4\nClinically, the therapeutic range bound by the dose that produces the minimal therapeutic effect and the dose that produces the maximal acceptable adverse effect is more relevant.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 26:\nMetformin does not require therapeutic monitoring because it does not have a narrow therapeutic index and the effect on blood sugar levels can be easily measured.\nPhenytoin, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine have the narrow therapeutic index and therapeutic monitoring is necessary to avoid adverse effects.",
