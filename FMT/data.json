        "explanation": ":\nFrom the given options, mineralization of teeth is the more accurate method of age determination in childhood.\nThe relationship between the chronological age and dental age is stronger than between chronological age and skeletal age.\nTwo aspects of tooth development have been used in the estimation of dental age:\nThe emergence of teeth - superior part of the crown of the tooth appearing level with the surface of the alveolar bone\nThe stage of mineralization of crowns and roots during development\nEstimation of dental age using mineralization stages of crowns and roots of developing teeth includes visualization from a radiographic image. This helps in viewing both erupted and unerupted teeth. It is a more accurate method of estimating age than emergence, because emergence is an event whose exact time of occurrence is not accurately known.\nThe study of dental microstructure is the most accurate method of age determination in childhood. This involves counting perikymata (incremental lines on the surface of tooth enamel).\nNote: Eruption is a continuous process by which a tooth moves from its crypt in the jaw bone to its position of occlusion in the mouth. It is different from emergence. Emergence denotes that a tooth has pierced the gingiva.",

There are three main racial groups, namely, Caucasian, Mongoloid and Negroid.\nAll the skulls cannot be accurately differentiated into the 3 broad categories because of racial mixing. The skull of an Indian is caucasian with a few negroid features.\nRace determination indices from other bones:\nUpper limb bones - Brachial index\nLower limb bones - Crural index\nBoth upper and lower limb - Intermembral index\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe skull of Indians can be classified as mesaticephalic. This type of skull is of intermediate length and width.\nThe skull of an Indian is caucasian with a few negroid characteristics. Because of racial mixing, the Indian skull cannot be correctly differentiated into the broad categories of dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic, and brachycephalic.\nNote: This is a controversial question. The use of the cephalic index for the determination of race has been discredited and the cephalic index of the entire Indian population cannot be generalized to belong to one category. But the best answer to this question is mesaticephalic.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nRound or ovoid cross section of hair is found in caucasian race. Race determination from hair:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nCarabelli\u2019s cusps are most commonly seen only in caucasian races and rare in the other major racial groups. These are small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars.\nThe image below shows Carabelli\u2019s cusps seen in caucasian races.\n\n\n\nFeatures of mongoloid dentition include:\nShovel-shaped upper central incisors - Posterior surfaces of these teeth have a central depression\nEnamel pearls - Small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface\nTaurodontism (bull-tooth) - Pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep\nA congenital lack of the third upper molar\nThe image below shows shovel-shaped upper central incisors seen in mongoloid races compared to non-shovel shaped incisors:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\n\nThe cusps of molars are wide and deep and cusps of incisors are shovel-shaped in Mongoloid races.\nAfricanoid races tend to have large teeth and often have more cusps on their molars, even up to eight, with two lingual cusps on the mandibular first premolars as an additional common finding.\nIn Caucasian races, the lateral incisors in the upper jaw are usually smaller than the central. They also have long pointed canine roots. Small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars, called Carabelli\u2019s cusp are most common in Caucasian races.\nIn mongoloid teeth, enamel pearls and small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface, are much more frequent. The condition of bull-tooth or taurodontism is most common in Mongoloid people. The pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep, and the roots are fused and bent. A congenital lack of the third upper molar is most commonly seen. The lingual and labial ridges are more prominent.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe preauricular sulcus is useful for sex determination. It is a groove on the iliac bone broad and deep in a female pelvis and narrow and shallow in a male pelvis.\nThe differences between male and female pelvis are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe number of Barr bodies in someone with 47XXY genetic makeup is 1, not 2. The number of Barr bodies is given by the formula n-1, where n is the number of X chromosomes.\nBarr body is a small planoconvex mass, lying near the nuclear membrane. It represents the inactivated X chromosome. Barr bodies are seen in 0-4% of genetic males (46XY) and 20-80% of genetic females (46XX).\nSites for sampling for sex chromatin include\nBuccal mucosa\nTooth pulp\nHair bulb\nDavidson body is a drumstick-shaped mass of chromatin hanging down from neutrophil nuclei. It is seen only in females (0-6%).\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nSternal index, corporobasal sacral index, and ischiopubic index are used to determine the sex of the individual.\nThe intermembral index and cephalic index are helpful in determining the race of the individual. Indices for sex determination:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe whole pelvis is the most reliable bone for sex determination.\nKrogman\u2019s degree of accuracy in sex determination from adult skeletal remains:\nEntire skeleton \u2013 100%\nPelvis plus skull \u2013 98%\nLong bones and pelvis &gt;95%\nPelvis alone \u2013 95%\nLong bones and skull - 90-95%\nSkull alone \u2013 90%\nLong bones alone \u2013 80-90%\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nMinimum age of a skeleton beyond which sex determination would be highly accurate is 14\u201316 years. This is because most marked changes regarding sex differences occur in the skeleton post-puberty.\nIn prepubertal skeletons, the chance of a correct sex allocation is only 50%. If the pelvis is present, the chances of correct sex allocation increases to about 80%.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nAmong the given options, a large acetabulum (only 5) is the characteristic of a male pelvis.\nTriangular obturator foramen, U-shaped pubic angle, everted ischial tuberosity, large greater sciatic notch, deep preauricular sulcus are characteristics of a female pelvis.\nThe differences between male and female pelvis are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe images marked as 1 and 4 show characteristics of a male pelvis and 2 and 3 show characteristics of a female pelvis.\n\n\nDifferences between male and female pelvis:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe structures marked as 1 and 2 are the frontal and parietal eminences. In a female skull, both frontal and parietal eminences are larger.\n\n\n\n\nDifferentiating features between male and female skull:\nThe features given above develop after puberty and are modified by senility. Hence, the differences are applicable only between 18-55 years.\nThe image given below shows a male and female skull.\nThe red arrow indicates frontal bossing, which is more apparent in the male skull.\nThe green arrow indicates nasal radix which is deeper in the male skull.\nThe yellow arrow indicates greater prominence of the chin in the male skull.\nThe blue arrow shows a greater mandibular height in the male skull.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe Bertillon system is used for identification based on anthropometry.\nThe origins of forensic anthropology can be traced to the end of the nineteenth century when the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon devised the first classification and identification system to identify criminals, based on anthropometry.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe approximate height of the individual is 150 cm.\nThe stature/femur relationship is 3.74. Thus, stature can be calculated by using the formula, stature = femur length x 3.74 = 40 x 3.74 = 149.6 cm \uf040 150 cm\nThe relationship between the mean stature and the mean length of the femur appears to be fairly stable around the world. However, this factor tends to overestimate tall and underestimate short individuals.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nPearson\u2019s formula is used for the estimation of stature. Methods of determination of stature:\nPearson's formula: Any bone may be used, but the measurement of one or more of the six long bones provides the most reliable estimates. The descending order of usefulness of bones is femur&gt; tibia&gt; humerus&gt; radius.\n\nTrotter and Gleser's method - Formula for stature (cm) = 1.30 (Femur + Tibia) + 63.29 (+/-2.99)\nStature/femur relationship - The relationship between the mean stature and the mean length of the femur appears to be fairly stable around the world which is 3.74.\nAnatomical method - This is the most accurate method. It consists of the sum of the following parameters:\nBasibregmatic height of the sku\nHeight of the vertebrae from the axis through the first sacral vertebra\nBicondylar length of the femur\nPhysiological length of the tibia\nArticulated height of the talus and calcaneus\nConstant is added to account for the soft tissues\nNote: Pearson also introduced the principle of regression.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nGestational age of this fetus is 6-7 months.\nCrown rump length + length of lower limb = crown heel length\nRule of Haase enables the estimation of the age of the fetus in lunar months from its crown-heel length (in cm).\nAccording to the rule,\nAge in months = Square root of crown-heel length (when the crown-heel length is 25 cm or less/ first 5 months).\nAge in months = crown-heel length divided by 5 (when the crown-heel length is more than 25 cm/ last 5 months).\nHere, crown heel length = Crown rump + lower limb length = 31 cm. Hence, gestational age = 31 / 5 = 6-7 months.\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe length of the vertebral column is 35% of the stature of an individual",
