Which of the following blood components can be used for emergency reversal of warfarin therapy in this patient?\nCryoprecipitate\nProthrombin complex concentrates\nFresh-frozen plasma\nPlatelets\n\n\nQuestion 14:\n\nCryoprecipitate is stored at a temperature of \t\n-20 \u00b0C\n-30 \u00b0C\n-40 \u00b0C\n-50 \u00b0C\n\n\nQuestion 15:\n\nA 22-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency room following a road traffic accident. Upon arrival, the patient was unconscious with blood pressure of 90/64 mmHg and a pulse rate of 139 per minute. He was immediately transfused with 4 units of packed RBCs. All of the following complications can occur in this patient except:\nHypercalcemia\nHyperkalemia\nHypokalemia\nMetabolic alkalosis\n\n\nQuestion 16:\n\nA young patient is brought to the emergency room following a motorcycle collision. On examination, the patient is drowsy and has decreased blood pressure due to bleeding from multiple injuries. 1 unit of packed RBCs has been obtained from the blood bank. What is the correct procedure for blood transfusion?\nThe blood should be brought to room temperature before the transfusion\nTransfusion should be started within one hour of removal from the refrigerator\nTransfusion of PRBC should be completed within 4 hours\nThe rate of transfusion of PRBC is 50mL per hour\n\n\nQuestion 17:\n\nA patient with a road traffic accident presented to the emergency room and requires a large amount of fluids to be transfused. Which of the following IV cannula is preferred?\nGreen\nBlue\nPink\nGrey\n\n\nQuestion 18:\n\nWhat is the size of the cannula shown in the below image?\n\n\n\n16 G\n18 G\n20 G\n22 G\n\n\nQuestion 19:\n\nWhich of the following is not a component of qSOFA?\nRespiratory rate \uf0b0 22/min\nSystolic BP \uf0a3100 mm Hg\nAltered mental status\nBilateral pupillary reflex\n\n\nQuestion 20:\n\nAll of the following are features of SIRS except:\nTemperature &gt; 38 degrees Celsius\nRespiratory Rate &gt; 20/minute and PaCO2 &lt;35 mmHg\nPulse rate &gt; 90/minute\nWBC &gt; 12000/mm3 or &lt; 4000/mm3\n\nAnswer Key\n\n\n\nDetailed Explanations\nSolution to Question 1:\nHypovolemic shock is the most common type of shock and to some degree is a component of all other types of shock.\nShock is defined as a systemic state of low tissue perfusion which is inadequate for normal cellular respiration.\nShock can be classified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe compensatory mechanism in shock reduces the perfusion to the skin, muscle and gastrointestinal tract and not to the kidney.\nAs shock progresses, the body\u2019s cardiovascular and endocrine compensatory responses reduce the blood flow to non-essential organs by vasoconstriction. This occurs in order to preserve preload and flow to the kidneys, lungs and brain.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe percentage of blood loss in class II hemorrhagic shock is 15\u201330%, which amounts to a loss of 750\u20131500 mL of blood.\nThe class II hemorrhagic shock is considered as a mild shock with heart rate more than 100. It is associated with orthostatic hypotension, and the patient is usually anxious at this stage.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given clinical scenario of Beck's triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds) is seen in cardiac tamponade. Shock due to cardiac tamponade is primarily an example of obstructive shock.\n\nObstructive shock is characterized by a reduction in preload due to mechanical obstruction of the cardiac filling of the left and/or right sides of the heart, which in turn leads to fall in cardiac output. Common causes of obstructive shock include:\nCardiac tamponade\nTension pneumothorax\nMassive pulmonary embolus or air embolus\nCardiogenic shock is due to primary failure of the heart to pump blood. It may be due to myocardial depression as a result of infarction, cardiomyopathy, blunt myocardial injury. Patients with cardiac tamponade may eventually develop cardiogenic shock as the myocardium is stressed against the obstruction.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe clinical scenario of the presence of hypotension associated with the spinal cord injury is suggestive of neurogenic shock. It is associated with bradycardia and not tachycardia.\nNeurogenic shock refers to reduced tissue perfusion due to loss of vasomotor tone to peripheral arterial beds.\nNeurogenic shock is usually secondary to spinal cord injuries due to vertebral body fractures of the cervical or high thoracic region that disrupts the sympathetic regulation of peripheral vascular tone. Loss of vasoconstrictor impulses results in increased vascular capacitance, decreased venous return and decreased cardiac output.\n\n\n\nThe classic description of neurogenic shock consists of:\nHypotension associated with bradycardia (absence of reflexive tachycardia due to disrupted sympathetic discharge)\nWarm extremities (due to loss of peripheral vasoconstriction)\n\nMotor and sensory deficits indicative of a spinal cord injury\nRadiographic evidence of a vertebral column fracture\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nModified shock index = HR/MAP\nOriginal shock index = HR/SBP\nThe shock index is a hemodynamic stability indicator. In patients with shock, it is a\nbetter predictor of mortality than blood pressure or heart rate alone. A shock index &gt;0.9 is indicative of higher mortality.\nThe modified shock index is a more sensitive indicator of tissue perfusion than the original shock index. In critically ill patients, the DBP decreases earlier than SBP, hence, the modified shock index using MAP is better suited to assess the severity of shock.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe peripheral vascular resistance is decreased in distributive shock.\nIt is the condition of reduced oxygen delivery where the primary physiologic disturbance is a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. It is unique among the types of shock in that there is a compensatory increase in cardiac output. The most common cause of distributive shock is sepsis.\nThe causes of vasodilatation in various types of distributive shock:\nThe following Table shows cardiovascular and metabolic characteristics of different types of shock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given clinical presentation is seen in septic shock.\nIn distributive (septic) shock, the peripheries are warm and capillary refill will be brisk, despite the profound shock.\nIn early stages (compensated stage) of septic shock, the patient has clammy, warm peripheries. The latter is a distinct feature from other types of shock where peripheral vasoconstriction leads to cold peripheries. The patient will have decreased vascular resistance, inadequate afterload, abnormally high cardiac output, and tachycardia.\nIn the later stages (uncompensated phase) of septic shock, there is reduced venous return, preload, and reduced cardiac output with low blood pressure.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of septic shock. Crystalloids are the initial fluid of choice in the resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock.\nSeptic shock is also known as vasodilatory shock (But remember vasopressors are not the first line).\nManagement protocol for septic shock:\nStep 1: Immediate evaluation - Securing the airway (if indicated) and correcting hypoxemia and establishing venous access for the early administration of fluids and antibiotics are priorities in the management of patients with sepsis and septic shock.\nStep 2: Initial resuscitative therapy - aggressive administration of intravenous fluids (IVF), usually crystalloids are given at 30 mL/kg (actual body weight) within the first three hours following the presentation. Empirical antibiotic therapy started within first hour.\nStep 3: Intravenous vasopressors are useful in patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation or who develop cardiogenic pulmonary edema.\nVasopressor agents such as phenylephrine, noradrenaline are indicated in distributive shock states which include septic shock, neurogenic shock, etc. where there is peripheral vasodilatation, and a low systemic vascular resistance, leading to hypotension. But they are not the first-line treatment.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nPlatelets have a shelf life of only 5 days and hence they have to be used at the earliest.\nThey are usually stored on a special agitator at 20\u201324 \u00b0C. They are given to the patients with thrombocytopenia or with platelet dysfunction who are bleeding or undergoing surgery.\nPacked cells (PRBCs) are stored in a SAG-M solution (saline\u2013adenine\u2013glucose\u2013mannitol) and has a shelf life of 42 days at 2\u20136 \u00b0C. (Older storage regimens included storage in CPD \u2013\ncitrate\u2013phosphate\u2013dextrose solutions which have a shelf life of 2\u20133 weeks.)\nFresh frozen plasma (FFP) is stored at \uf02d40 to \uf02d50\u00b0C, while cryoprecipitate is stored at -30\u00b0C, and both have a shelf life of one years.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe optimal level of Hb to be maintained, in this case, is 8 gm/dL. The indications for blood transfusion are as follows:\nAcute blood loss: To replace circulating volume and maintain oxygen delivery.\nPerioperative anemia: To ensure adequate oxygen delivery during the perioperative phase.\nSymptomatic chronic anemia: without hemorrhage or impending surgery.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).\nThe presence of antibodies against the Human Leukocyte antigen (Anti-HLA Ab) in the donor blood is implicated in the development of TRALI.\nTRALI is defined as an acute lung injury that is temporally related to blood transfusion and causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It occurs within the first six hours following a transfusion. Screening for HLA antibodies has been introduced to prevent TRALI.\nTRALI usually results from the transfusion of donor plasma that contains high-titer anti-HLA class II antibodies that bind to recipient leukocytes. The leukocytes aggregate in the pulmonary\n\nvasculature and release mediators that increase capillary permeability. Testing the donor\u2019s plasma for anti-HLA antibodies can support this diagnosis.\nThe implicated donors are frequently multiparous women. The transfusion of plasma from male and nulliparous women donors reduces the risk of TRALI.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nProthrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs) are indicated for the emergency reversal of anticoagulant (warfarin) therapy in uncontrolled hemorrhage.\nPCCs are highly purified concentrates prepared from pooled plasma. They contain factors II, IX and X. Factor VII may be included or produced separately.\nFresh frozen plasma and platelets are used in management of coagulopathy. Fresh frozen plasma is used if prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt;1.5 times\nnormal. Platelets are transfused if platelet count &lt;50 x103/ul.\nHowever, in the presence of non-surgical haemorrhage these tests take time to arrange and may underestimate the degree of coagulopathy.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nCryoprecipitate is a supernatant precipitate of FFP (fresh frozen plasma) and is rich in factor VIII and fibrinogen.\nIt is stored at \uf02d30 \u00b0C and has a shelf life of two years. It is given in low fibrinogen states or factor VIII deficiency.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe complication of massive transfusion includes hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia.\nThe lethal triad of massive transfusion includes acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. Other complications which can be seen in massive transfusion are:\nHypocalcaemia\nHyperkalemia\nHypokalemia\nHypomagnesemia\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\n\nThe transfusion of packed RBCs (PRBC) should be completed within a maximum period of 4 hours after the removal from the blood fridge.\nThere is an increased risk of bacterial proliferation and loss of the function of blood components after they are removed from the storage temperatures. Hence, the transfusion should be started within 30 minutes of receiving the components from the blood bank. The packed RBCs should be infused at a rate of 100-150mL/hour. Warming of blood is not needed when the transfusion is at normal rates. The transfusion should be completed within a maximum period of 4 hours.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nGrey coloured IV cannula is required for this patient in order to transfuse large amount of fluids.\nThe ATLS 10th edition guidelines state that 2 cannulae of atleast 18G should be used to gain vascular access in trauma patients. In this scenario requiring large fluid transfusions, the grey (16G) cannula would be preferable to the green (18G) cannula due to the higher flow rate.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given cannula is 20 gauge IV cannula as its color code is pink.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nSepsis is defined as a \u201clife-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.\u201d It lies in the continuous spectrum between infection and septic shock.\nqSOFA score (quickSOFA) is a bedside prompt that may identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the intensive care unit (ICU).\nIt uses three criteria, assigning one point each for\now blood pressure (SBP\uf0a3100 mmHg),\nhigh respiratory rate (\uf0b0 22 breaths per min)\naltered mentation (Glasgow coma scale, &lt;15).\n\nThe score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points is a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis.\nThe primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected infection is by determining the Sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; which includes assessment of:\nCirculation - Systolic BP &amp; need for vasopressors; platelet count\nRespiration - PaO2/FiO2 &amp; need for mechanical ventilation\nMentation - Glasgow Coma Score\nHepatic function - Bilirubin\nRenal function - Creatinine\nOrgan dysfunction is identified by a SOFA score of \uf0b0 2\nThe SOFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex and time-consuming. In order to simplify the scoring process, the \"Sepsis - 3\" task force recommended the quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment \"qSOFA\" score.\nSOFA Vs qSOFA :\nSOFA is a more comprehensive and accurate scoring system which is particulary superior to qSOFA in the ICU setting.\nqSOFA is a simplified derivative of SOFA for bedside assessment of individuals at risk for sepsis particularly useful outside the ICU. setting (i.e. ward / emergency department). However, note that it was originally designed as predictive tool that calculates the risk of death from sepsis rather than a diagnostic tool.\nThereby, the best description of sepsis based on \"Sepsis -3\" task force recommendations would be\n:\nSuspected or documented infection with SOFA score \uf0b0 2 Or\nSuspected or documented infection with qSOFA score \uf0b0 2\nAnother score that has been used is the NEWS(National Early Warning Score). It ranges from 0 to 20 and is based on respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, use of supplemental O2, temperature, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate and level of consciousness. \uf0b0 5 out of 20 is considered a positive score.\nOther scoring systems for sepsis:\nThe Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score is no longer recommended as is it not specific to infection.\nThe Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score is not recommended as it is complex and has too many variables.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nRespiratory Rate &gt; 20/minute or (Not and) PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg (Not &lt;35 mmHg) would be a feature of SIRS (Systemic inflammatory response syndrome).\n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an exaggerated defense response of the body to a noxious stressor (infection, trauma, surgery, acute inflammation, ischemia, or reperfusion) to localize and then eliminate the endogenous or exogenous source of the insult.\nSIRS is diagnosed when any two of the following are present:\nHyperthermia (&gt;38 Degree Celsius) or Hypothermia (&lt;36 Degree Celsius)\nTachypnoea (&gt;20/min) or PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg\nTachycardia (&gt;90/min)\nWhite cell count &gt;12 x 109/liter or &lt;4 x 109/liter or &gt;10% Band forms Sepsis is SIRS with a documented infection.\n\nInstruments & Sutures\n\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nIdentify the instrument:\n\n\nAllis tissue forceps\nBabcock\u2019s forceps\nLane\u2019s tissue holding forceps\nKocher\u2019s hemostatic forceps\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nFor which of the following would you use the instrument shown in the image?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,2 and 4\n1 and 3\n3,4 and 5\n1,2 and 3\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nYou notice your surgery resident use the given instrument to remove gall stones.

The tip is non-traumatic with transverse serrations. It has a lock in the proximal part.\nIt is used to hold tubular structures such as parts of the bowel, fallopian tube, appendix, ureter, etc.\n\n\n\nOption A: Allis tissue forceps have distal blades, not opposing each other. The tip has got teeth in each blade that are opposing. There is a lock in the proximal part.\nIt is used to hold skin flaps, fascia, aponeurosis, and the bladder wall.\n\n\n\nOption C: Lane\u2019s tissue holding forceps have got stout and thick distal blades with oval fenestrae. It has an opposing tooth on the tip and a lock in the proximal part.\nIt is used to hold bulky and tough structures and lymph nodes.\n\n\n\n\nOption D: Kocher\u2019s hemostatic forceps - It is identified by the opposing tooth on the tip and serrations in the distal blades.\nIt is used to hold pedicles, tough structures, and cut ends of muscles. It is also used to hold ribs during rib dissection, gauze for blunt dissection, and resected bowel.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe image shows a sponge holding forceps. It is used to:\nClean skin with a swab dipped in antiseptic solution during all operations\nRemove laminated membrane and daughter cysts during operation of hydatid cyst.\nHold the fundus and Hartmann\u2019s pouch of gall bladder during cholecystectomy\n\nSwab an abscess cavity\nHold the cervix during cerclage.\n\n\n\nOvum forceps is shown below. It is used to grasp products of conception and prevent the crushing of the conceptus. They have no catch and the blades are slightly bent and fenestrated. The absence of catch minimizes uterine injury if accidentally caught.\nIt is introduced with the blades closed and opened up inside the uterine cavity to grasp the products. The instrument is taken out with a slight rotatory movement. The rotatory movement not only facilitates detachment of the products from the uterine wall, but also minimizes the injury of the uterine wall if accidentally grasped.\n\n\nPile holding forceps are used to hold haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\nCord holding forceps are typically used to hold spermatic cords.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe above instrument is Desjardin\u2019s choledocholithotomy forceps and is used for bile duct stone removal. It may also be used during the removal of kidney, ureteric, or bladder stones.\nThis is a long and slender instrument. There are finger bows but no catch. The shaft is curved. The blades are small, without serrations, and fenestrated centrally.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\n\nThe above image is of Lister\u2019s sinus forceps which are used for blunt dissection. It is used during Hilton's method of abscess drainage to break the bacterial loculi. It is also used for inserting or removing packing in the sinus cavity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nDoyen\u2019s mouth gag is used to keep the mouth open for intraoral surgery when retraction of the tongue is not required or desirable. Mostly used for tongue surgery. It is applied on one side of the mouth on the molar teeth.\n\n\n\nOption A: Doyen\u2019s retractor is used to retract the abdominal wall in abdominal and pelvic surgeries to expose the field of operation.\n\n\n\n\nOption C: Doyen\u2019s intestinal occlusion clamp is used for resection and anastomosis of the intestine in cases of:\nStrangulated hernia\nAccidental injuries to the gut\nIntestinal growths\nGastric/intestinal bypass surgeries.\n\n\n\nOption D: Joll\u2019s thyroid retractor is a self-retaining retractor used in thyroid surgeries to retract skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given image shows a Morris retractor with a single, flat transversely curved blade and a blunt projecting ridge with backward projection.\nMorris retractor can be single or double-bladed. It is used to retract abdominal wall incisions, loin incisions, subcostal wounds or any wounds in depth.\nIt can be used to improve visibility on one side of an incision. Thus, it is valuable during the initial phase of a laparotomy.\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Deaver's retractor is a question mark-shaped stout, atraumatic retractor with a broad, gently curved long blade. It is used to retract the abdominal wall and viscera. Moist mops should\n\nbe kept underneath prior to placing this retractor. It is used for major abdominal surgeries, bladder surgeries and lumbar sympathectomy.\n\n\nOption C: Czerny's retractor is a superficial retractor with a thick and small blade on one side and a biflanged hook on the other side in opposite directions. It is used in hernia surgery and laparotomy, especially during closure.\n\n\nOption D: Double-hook retractor consists of two hooks with a handle. It is used in excision of swellings like lipoma, neurofibroma and cyst. It is also used to hold the skin flaps when raising them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe Deaver\u2019s retractor would be most useful in cholecystectomy as it is specifically designed for holding the liver up and out of the way.\nDeaver\u2019s retractor is used carefully to avoid damaging the liver. Some surgeons protect the liver with an abdominal pack before placing the blade on top.\n\n\n\nDoyen's retractor - It is used to retract the abdominal wall as well as the bladder for proper exposure of the lower uterine segment during a cesarian section.\n\n\n\n\nMorris retractor is a large retractor useful for providing maximum exposure in large incisions e.g., abdominal incisions. It can be used to improve visibility on one side of an incision. Thus, it is valuable during the initial phase of a laparotomy.\n\n\n\n\nCzerny's retractor - This is a double-ended retractor used to retract wound edges for intermediate-type procedures. One end has a blade with a lip which helps to retract without the edge slipping. The other end has two prongs and helps to retract the ends of an incision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above image is that of a Langenbeck retractor. It is used for holding open wounds, as in an open appendicectomy.\nOption B: Dyball retractor is used in major abdominal surgeries to retract deeper parts of the abdominal wall, bladder, or uterus while operating on the rectum and entering the rectovesical or rectouterine pouch. It has a lip at the bottom of the blade to prevent slippage. Care should be taken when it is used to retract the liver as it may damage the liver parenchyma.\n\n\n\nOption C: Goligher retractor is a self-retaining retractor used in operations on the sigmoid colon and rectum, such as anterior resection and the upper end of abdominoperineal resection. The retractor is inserted with the side blades to separate the edges of the abdominal wall. The central blade is then inserted to keep the small bowel away from the operation site.\n\n\n\n\nOption D: Travers retractor is a self-retaining retractor used for intermediate-type operations, such as:\nHerniorrhaphy\nGroin dissection for varicose veins\nFemoral embolectomy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe image shows Kocher\u2019s thyroid dissector which is used during a thyroidectomy to dissect the upper pole of the thyroid.\nThe instrument is blunt and therefore damage to the superior thyroid artery or external laryngeal nerve is unlikely.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe size of the surgical blade shown is the 11-size blade (stab knife) that has a triangular shape with an oblique edge and a sharp-pointed tip.\nUses:\nIncision and drainage (I &amp; D) of an abscess\nInsertion of drains and arteriotomy. Other options:\nOption A: The 10-size blade is used for skin incisions. It has a curved cutting edge that tapers to a pointed tip.\nOption C: The 22-size blade is often used for abdominal incisions. It has a flat, unsharpened back edge and a curved front cutting edge.\nOption D: The 15-size blade is used for minor surgical procedures (lipoma excision) and precise skin incisions. It is a smaller blade with a small cutting edge.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given image shows the suture material exiting the knot is on the same side as the entry i.e no cross-over is seen. This is seen in a reef knot.\nA knot is a fastening made of threads intertwined together or on themselves. Each knot consists of- 2 half-hitches placed in sequential throws. Squaring refers to tightening the knot/half-hitch in a manner that the threads lay flat due to the alternating direction of half-hitches in adjacent layers.\nTypes of knots:\n\nGranny knot: half-hitch over a half-hitch in the same direction. It has better-holding power than alf-hitc\nReef knot: half-hitch followed by a second half-hitch after squaring.\nTriple throw knot: Reef knot with another half-hitch knot for added security. Knots made wit prolene sutures require 6-8 throws to prevent slippage.\nSurgeon\u2019s knot: Modification of the reef knot with two half-hitches in the first layer.\nSlip knot: Modification of either granny/reef knot formed when one end of the thread is kept taut while tightening the knot.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given image shows interrupted sutures. Horizontal mattress sutures, not interrupted sutures, have the least cut-through rate.\nIn mattress suture, the initial suture is inserted as an interrupted suture, but then the needle either moves horizontally or vertically and traverses both edges of the wound once again as seen in the picture.\n\n\n\n\nContinuous suture: For a continuous suture, the first suture is inserted in an identical manner to an interrupted suture, but the rest of the sutures are inserted in a continuous manner until the far end of the wound is reached.\n\n\n\nSubcuticular sutures: Small bites of the subcuticular tissues are taken on alternate sites of the wound and then gently pulled together thus approximating the wound edges without the risk of the cross-hatched markings of interrupted sutures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe suture material shown in the image is plain catgut. It is a yellowish absorbable suture material.\nChromic catgut is brownish in colour.\nVicryl is a violet-coloured absorbable suture material.\n\n\nSilk is a black-coloured, multifilament, natural, braided, and non-absorbable suture material. It is derived from the cocoon of the silkworm larva.\n\n\n\nProlene is a blue coloured, monofilament, non-absorbable suture.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nChromic catgut is absorbed through macrophage phagocytosis and enzymatic degradation within 90 days.\nIt is made from collagen derived from healthy sheep or cattle. It is then tanned with chromium salts to improve handling and resist degradation in tissue.\nThe tensile strength lasts for 21-28 days. It has a moderate tissue reaction as compared to plain catgut, which has a high tissue reactivity.\nIt is used to ligate superficial vessels, suture subcutaneous tissues, and is used for stomas and other tissues that heal rapidly. It is not used in tissues that heal slowly and require prolonged\n\nsupport.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe best method for the management of face laceration is a subcuticular suture with poliglecaprone (monocryl).\nSubcuticular sutures are used in the areas of the skin where the cosmetic appearance is important. The suture material is taken from the subcuticular layer and the edges are gently pulled together. The wound heals with minimal scarring.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nPolypropylene (prolene), a non-absorbable monofilament, is the ideal suture material used for vascular anastomoses.\nVascular anastomosis requires an accurate and watertight closure. A non-absorbable material that provides tensile strength for a longer period is best suited. The material should also be\nnon-braided to avoid platelet adherence to the suture material.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe image given is of polyglactin (vicryl). It is absorbed by hydrolysis. Complete absorption occurs by 60\u201390 days.\nIt is a violet, braided multifilament absorbable suture. It is a copolymer of lactide and glycolide in a ratio of 90:10, coated with polyglactin and calcium stearate.\nIt is used mostly for gut anastomoses, vascular ligatures, subcuticular wound closures, and ophthalmic surgeries.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe image shows Kehr\u2019s T tube used after choledochotomy.\nThe horizontal limb is placed in the common bile duct while the vertical limb is brought out like a drain.\n\n\n\nIt allows bile to drain while the sphincter of Oddi is in spasm postoperatively. Once the sphincter relaxes, bile drains normally down the bile duct and into the duodenum.\nCommon bile duct T-tubes should remain in for 10 days. The 10-day period is required to minimize the risk of biliary peritonitis.\nOnce the T-tube cholangiogram has shown that there is a free flow of bile into the duodenum and that there are no retained stones, it is removed. Some surgeons like to clamp the T-tube prior to removal. Residual obstruction may be amenable to stone extraction via the T-tube.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nAll the given options can be used to stop esophageal variceal bleeding.\nImage A shows the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. It has 3 lumens - one aspiration port and 2 inflation balloons. They are:\nGastric aspiration port\nGastric balloon port\nEsophageal balloon port\nThe gastric balloon is inflated and tension is applied to the gastroesophageal junction. If this does not control the haemorrhage, the esophageal balloon is inflated as well, compressing the venous plexus between them. Only gastric contents can be aspirated.\n\n\n\nImage B shows the Minnesota tube. It has 4 openings - 2 inflation tubes and 2 suction tubes i.e. both gastric and oesophageal aspiration ports are present, which allows the aspiration of both gastric and esophageal contents.\nImages C and D both show an upper GI endoscope. They are used to identify the source of bleeding and once identified, sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal banding are performed, which have been shown to control hemorrhage effectively.\nBanding has a lower rate of complications. If bleeding does not stop by banding/sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade should be tried.\nThe protocol for the management of esophageal varices is given below.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\n\nA Malecot catheter is never introduced per-urethrally.\nIt is a self-retaining catheter with an umbrella or flower tip. It contains sulfur, hence is radio-opaque. It can be sterilized by boiling.\nUses:\nSuprapubic cystostomy\nPerinephric abscess\nPyonephrosis\nCabot\u2019s nephrostomy\nSubphrenic abscess\nCholecystotomy\nInfected pseudocyst of pancreas\nAmoebic liver abscess\nGastrostomy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe Foley's catheter having a green coloured ring in the ballon port is of size 14 F. If there is difficulty in catheterization, then a lower French number should be preferred.\nThe French scale refers to the external diameter of the catheter, and 1Fr is 0.3 mm in diameter.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\n\nFrench with respect to Foley catheter refers to the external diameter of the catheter, and 1Fr is 0.3 mm in diameter.\nOption B: Latex Foley catheter can be kept for one week whereas silicone Foley catheter can be kept for up to 6 weeks (some studies say 2-3 months).\nOption C: Three-way Foley catheter, shown below, is used for irrigation and helps in preventing clot retention following surgeries like TURP.\n\n\nOption D: If there is peri-urethral leakage of urine after inserting a Foley, inflating the balloon slightly more or using a larger-sized Foley are the corrective measures.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nVeress needle is used to produce pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery.\n\nA blunt trocar is passed through the sharp needle.\nInsufflation of the abdomen is accomplished with a Veress needle held at its serrated collar with the thumb and forefinger. Since the linea alba is fused to the umbilicus, the abdominal wall is grasped with fingers or a penetrating towel clip to elevate it away from the underlying structures.\n\n\n\nOption A: An aneurysm needle (shown below) is used to catch small vessels and nerves.\n\n\n\nOption C: Tracheal dilator is used to keep the tracheostomy open.\n\n\n\nOption D: Urethral dilator is used to dilate urethra.",
