They include:\nAmplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases.\nOverexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown experimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.\nNilotinib retains inhibitory activity in the presence of most point mutations that confer resistance to imatinib."
