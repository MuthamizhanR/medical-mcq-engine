It results in an abrupt decrease in blood pressure resulting in reflex tachycardia.\nIncreased contractility leads to an increase in O2 demand which may precipitate angina.\nOption A: Amlodipine and extended-release preparations of nifedipine do not cause a steep fall in blood pressure and subsequent activation of sympathetic tone. Therefore, they are less likely to precipitate angina.\nOptions C and D: Verapamil and diltiazem have relatively less action on peripheral vascular smooth muscles.

In the absence of drugs, arterioles in the ischemic areas are usually maximally dilated as a result of local compensatory mechanisms.\nWhen dipyridamole is administered, it acts as a nonselective arteriolar dilator. It can only dilate the vessels of the normal myocardium as the vessels of the ischemic myocardium are already maximally dilated. This diverts (steals) the blood away from the ischemic myocardium towards the normal myocardium. This is termed as coronary steal phenomenon.\n\n\n",

It is approved as a second-line agent for chronic angina.\nRanolazine acts by reducing late sodium current (INa) that facilitates calcium entry via the sodium-calcium exchanger. The reduction in intracellular calcium concentration results in decreased cardiac contractility. Additionally, it also reduces cardiac fatty acid oxidation and stimulates glucose metabolism. It results in a small decrease in HBA1c, thus improving glycemic control.\n\nIt is metabolized by CYP3A4 and hence should not be used with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as macrolides, imidazole antibiotics, and HIV protease inhibitors.\nThe most frequent side effects are dizziness, headache, nausea, and constipation.

Their excessive activity has been noted in coronary spasm and pulmonary hypertension. Inhibiton of these enzymes results in vascular relaxation.\nOption B: Ranolazine acts by reducing late sodium current (INa).

Nitrates relax the smooth muscles of epicardial coronary arteries and relieve coronary artery spasm.\nIn the case of stable angina, the primary mechanism of action of nitrates is preferential dilatation of veins (by increasing cGMP). Venous dilatation leads to a decrease in the venous return to the heart (preload). This decreases the ventricular end-diastolic volume and thereby a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. The diastolic perfusion pressure (aortic blood pressure in diastole - left ventricular pressure in diastole) is increased.\n\n\n",

When sodium nitrite is administered, it releases the nitrite ion. This ion binds to hemoglobin to form methemoglobin. The methemoglobin so formed, has a high affinity for the cyanide ion and binds to it, thus, detaching it from the cytochrome oxidase. This regenerates active cytochrome normalizing the function of ETC.\nThe cyanide ion with methemoglobin forms cyanmethemoglobin.

Among them, guidelines recommend chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide because of its longer duration of action.\nFirst-choice drugs used in the treatment of hypertension in patients without any comorbidities include:\nACE inhibitors or ARBs: No evidence of superiority of one class over the other. However, ACE inhibitors have a higher risk of side effects like dry cough and angioedema.\n\nCalcium channel blockers: Extended-release, long-acting dihydropyridines are preferred.\n\nThiazide diuretics: Chlorthalidone is usually preferred to hydrochlorothiazide.\nLoop diuretics like furosemide and torsemide are less effective antihypertensives than thiazides.

This is known as the first-dose phenomenon. After a few initial doses, tolerance develops to this side effect. Initiating low doses at bedtime is recommended to minimize this phenomenon.\n\n\n\nTelmisartan can be given safely in a patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) because it is mainly cleared from circulation by biliary excretion.\nOptions A and D: Sucralfate is a basic aluminum salt of sucrose sulfate. Sucralfate, aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide in CRF patients can cause the accumulation of Al3+ and Mg2+ ions as they are preferentially excreted via the kidney after systemic absorption. Absorbed Al3+ can contribute to osteoporosis, encephalopathy and proximal myopathy in CRF patients.\nOption B: Candesartan is cleared from circulation by renal and biliary excretion.

They act on the thick ascending loop of Henle by blocking Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter.\nOption A: Although 65% of Na+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, diuretics acting here do not have maximum efficacy. This is because the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle has a great reabsorptive capacity and it absorbs most of the filtrate from the proximal tubule.\nOptions C and D: Diuretics acting distal to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle have limited efficacy because most of the reabsorption of Na+ (&gt;90%) would have already occurred by the time the tubular fluid reaches there.\n\n\n",

It causes a decrease in sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubule. As a result, spironolactone promotes sodium diuresis but maintains body potassium levels.\nSpironolactone is particularly helpful in edematous states caused or exacerbated by hyperaldosteronism such as in cirrhotic ascites.\n\n\n",

The condition is sometimes treated with thiazide diuretics but not amiloride.\n\nAmiloride is a K+ sparing diuretic that acts by inhibiting the epithelial Na+ channels. The various uses of amiloride are:\nEdema/hypertension - usually in combination with thiazides\nLithium-induced polyuria - blocks lithium transport into collecting tubules\nCystic fibrosis - aerosolized amiloride enhances mucociliary clearance; acts by inhibiting Na+ absorption from epithelial surfaces and increasing hydration of secretions\nLiddle syndrome - hyperactive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) activity is reduced\n\n\n\nThe diuretic effect of theophylline is due to the blockade of adenosine (A1) receptors. Theophylline is a methylxanthine drug that acts by -\nInhibition of phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE)\nPDE3 inhibition - relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle\nPDE4 inhibition - inhibition cytokines and chemokine release, which leads to a decrease in immune cell migration and activation\nBlockade of adenosine receptors inhibits bronchoconstriction, however, blockade of A1 receptors in the glomerular afferent arteriole and PCT causes diuresis.\nActivating enzyme histone deacetylase-2, which is responsible for its anti-inflammatory action\n\nAnti-Arrythmic Drugs\n\n",

Raw: Question 17:\n\nWhich of the following statements about dronedarone is incorrect?\nIt does not contain iodine moiety\nHas stronger antiadrenergic effects than amiodarone\nLess effective antiarrhythmic when compared to amiodarone\nDose adjustment has to be done in renal failure\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nDronedarone undergoes hepatic metabolism and hence dose adjustment is not required in renal failure as it is not excreted through the kidneys.\nDronedarone is a non-iodinated congener of amiodarone. Like amiodarone, it is a blocker of multiple ion channels. It has stronger antiadrenergic effects than amiodarone. It is less effective in maintaining sinus rhythm and is considered less antiarrhythmic when compared to amiodarone.\nUnlike amiodarone, it does not cause thyroid dysfunction or pulmonary fibrosis. However, it causes hepatotoxicity and increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.\n\n\n",

It causes\na compensatory increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis but LDL cholesterol is decreased. Statins block this enhanced cholesterol synthesis (cholesterol synthesis inhibitors) and so their combination has a synergistic effect.\nOption B: Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug that acts by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipase and thus interferes with the digestion and absorption of dietary triglycerides.\nOption C: Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant. The bile-acid sequestrants are highly positively charged and bind negatively charged bile acids. Because of their large size, the resins are not absorbed, and the bound bile acids are excreted in the stool.\nCholestyramine primarily reduces LDL levels by increasing hepatic bile acid synthesis; which results in increased LDL uptake and diversion of cholesterol to bile acid production.\nOption D: Niacin reduces lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and reduces hepatic triglyceride synthesis.\n\n\n",

ACE inhibitors induced hypotension is thereby due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. In diuretic-treated patients, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is more active to compensate for volume loss. Hence, ACE inhibitors increase the risk of postural hypotension in these patients.\nOption A: ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.\nOption C: Lisinopril is longer acting than enalapril. Lisinopril is usually administered once daily in all patients.

Therefore, they are contraindicated in pregnancy.\nPatient 2: ACE inhibitors can be used with caution in unilateral renal artery stenosis if the other kidney is functioning normally.\nPatient 3: Efferent arteriolar constriction maintains the glomerular filtration pressure in bilateral renal artery stenosis. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in bilateral renal stenosis as they can precipitate acute renal failure due to dilation of efferent arterioles and fall in glomerular filtration pressure.\nPatient 4: ACE inhibition in patients with systolic dysfunction prevents or delays the progression of heart failure, decreases the incidence of sudden death and myocardial infarction, and improves the quality of life.

Which of the following effects would you expect to see in this patient?\nRightward shift in renal pressure natriuresis curve\nReduction in filtration fraction\nSignificant increase in heart rate\nDecrease in compliance of large arteries\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nACE inhibitors, when used for a long time in patients with hypertension, cause a reduction in filtration fraction.\nFiltration fraction is the ratio of GFR to that of renal plasma flow. ACE inhibitors increase renal blood flow without altering GFR and thus result in reduction of filtration fraction.\nOption A: The graph plotted between urinary sodium excretion and mean blood pressure is known as the pressure natriuresis curve. For example, when dietary sodium intake is low, renin release is stimulated. Angiotensin II acts on the kidneys to shift the renal pressure \u2013 natriuresis curve to the right. This increases sodium and water retention.\nConversely, when dietary Na+ is high or when ACE inhibitors are used, there is the withdrawal of angiotensin II. The renal pressure natriuresis curve shifts to the left.\nThe following image depicts a pressure natriuresis curve:\n\n\n\n\nOptions C and D: ACE inhibitors do not cause a significant increase in heart rate and can have a favorable change in the compliance of large arteries on long-term use.\n\n\n",

However, bradykinin-mediated angioedema, though less common, can result due to hereditary or acquired defects in C1 esterase inhibitor and as a side effect of ACE inhibitors.\nACE has structural similarity to another enzyme called kininase. Kininase normally metabolizes bradykinin, substance P, and prostaglandins. ACE inhibitors when administered also block kininase enzyme which results in an increase in the concentration of these substrates. An increase in the level of bradykinin/ substance P levels results in persistent brassy cough and angioedema in the patients.\n\n\n",

The drug of choice for this condition is desmopressin, a V2 receptor agonist.\nMechanism of action of desmopressin is: It stimulates the V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of the principal cells in the collecting tubules. This increases the insertion of water channels (aquaporin 2) into the apical membrane. This leads to increased water reabsorption in the collecting ducts. Activation of V2 receptors also increase the permeability of urea.\nOption B: Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is indicated for lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\nOption C: Thiazides paradoxically exert an antidiuretic effect in DI but are not the drugs of choice. They are generally used in nephrogenic DI.\nOption D: Triamterene is also a potassium-sparing diuretic that can be used to treat nephrogenic DI.\nNote: Patients with DI usually do not develop overt signs of dehydration due to increased intake of water to compensate for polyuria.

It is a concern when desmopressin is used in bleeding disorders because\nlong-term use of desmopressin can cause depletion of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor stores.\nThe usefulness of desmopressin in bleeding disorders is limited to preoperative preparation, postoperative bleeding, excessive menstrual bleeding, and emergency situations.

Option B: Desmopressin is not indicated in nephrogenic DI.\nOption D: Bedtime administration of desmopressin for primary nocturnal enuresis provides a high response rate that is sustained with long-term use. However, intranasal desmopressin is no longer recommended for the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis because of the increased risk of hyponatremia.\n\n\n",

Which of the following drugs would you prescribe?\nSuvorexant\nDoxepin\nRitanserin\nAgomelatine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nSuvorexant is an inhibitor of both orexin1 and orexin2 receptors. It is approved for the treatment of insomnia.\nOrexins are produced in the lateral hypothalamus neurons and play a major role in maintaining the sleep cycle. Orexins promote wakefulness, while antagonists at orexin receptors enhance REM and non-REM sleep.\nOption B: Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant and has H1 receptor antagonism effect. It is used for insomnia at lower doses.\nOption C: Ritanserin is a 5HT2A/2C receptor antagonist indicated in insomnia.\nOption D: Agomelatine is a melatonin receptor agonist and a 5HT2C receptor antagonist indicated in insomnia.\n\nDiazepam and its long-acting metabolites can accumulate significantly in elderly patients with liver disease and therefore should not be used in such cases.\nDiazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine. It is metabolized in the liver to active metabolites like nordazepam which are long-acting. Nordazepam is further converted to oxazepam which is conjugated with glucuronic acid to form inactive metabolites.\nLorazepam, oxazepam, and triazolam are also metabolized in the liver but do not form long-acting active metabolites. As such, they can be used in elderly patients with liver disease but with caution.\nOxazepam and lorazepam are intermediate-acting and undergo glucuronide conjugation directly to form inactive metabolites.\nTriazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine.

Which of the following drugs can be used to treat this patient?\nCarbamazepine\nPhenytoin\nOxcarbazepine\nPhenobarbital\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of refractory seizures induced by hyponatremia caused by SIADH (due to anticancer drugs). Phenytoin is used to treat this patient. It is known to decrease ADH secretion and stop seizures by correcting severe hyponatremia.\nOptions A and C: Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine increase the antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\nlevels. This leads to increased sensitivity of renal tubules to ADH levels and hyponatremia. Carbamazepine cannot be used in SIADH because of its antidiuretic effects.\nOption D: Phenobarbital does not affect ADH secretion or action and thus will be ineffective in stopping the seizures.\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 7:\n\nA 51-year-old male complains of severe, sharp, piercing intermittent electrical shock-like pain sensation on the left side of his face. The pain was triggered by talking, washing his face, eating, and brushing his teeth. Which of the following drugs is most effective to treat this patient?\nPhenytoin\nCarbamazepine\nSodium valproate\nLamotrigine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe clinical features in this patient are suggestive of a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and carbamazepine is the most effective agent for its treatment.\nIf carbamazepine is ineffective, then second-line agents like lamotrigine and phenytoin are used. Sodium valproate although effective for trigeminal neuralgia lacks enough evidence for use.\n",

It is used in:\nFocal seizures with impaired awareness\nFocal seizures with intact awareness\nGeneralized tonic-clonic seizures\nTrigeminal and related neuralgias\nManic depressive psychosis.\nOption B: Carbamazepine is an enzyme inducer. It is a substrate as well as an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.\nOption C: Carbamazepine causes hyponatremia and not hypernatremia. Other side effects of carbamazepine include agranulocytosis or aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, water retention and hyponatremia (by potentiating ADH action ), and dose-related neurotoxicity.\nOption D: It is not used in status epilepticus.

Raw: Question 11:\n\nWhich of the following routes of administration will not bypass hepatic first-pass metabolism?\nSublingual\nOral\nIntravenous\nTransdermal\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nHepatic first-pass metabolism occurs in drugs administered via the oral route.\nWhen drugs are given orally, they are absorbed in the intestine and reach the liver through the portal vein. During this process, the drug is acted on by enzymes of the liver and intestine.\nAdditionally, the liver may excrete part of the drug in the bile, further reducing the bioavailability. This is called the first-pass metabolism.\nIn all the other routes, the drug directly enters systemic circulation without reaching the liver.\nNote: Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Hence, the bioavailability of a drug administered intravenously (I.V)\nis 100%. It is neither subjected to the first-pass metabolism as in the oral route nor does it depend on local factors as in subcutaneous, intramuscular, or transdermal.\n\n\n",

At a pH of 7.2, 50% will be unionized. In a more basic plasma (pH=7.4), a lesser fraction (around 40%) will be unionized.\nSmall changes in pH near pKa of a drug may cause large variations in the degree of ionization.\n\n\n",

The analgesic activity of this drug is mainly exerted by which of the following?\nIncreasing the duration of GABA Cl- channel opening\nInhibiting the GABA transaminase enzyme\nInhibiting the uptake of GABA at the presynaptic membrane\nInhibiting the Ca2+ channel current\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nGabapentin exerts its analgesic activity by inhibiting the Ca2+ channel current in this patient who is most likely suffering from post-herpetic neuralgia.\nGabapentin and pregabalin have close structural similarity to GABA. Still, they do not act through the effects of GABA receptors or any other mechanism related to GABA-mediated neurotransmission.\nThey inhibit the calcium channel current which decreases the entry of calcium in the presynaptic neuron. When calcium entry in the neuron is reduced, there is a decrease in the release of glutamate. This lowers the excitability of the neuron, thus reducing seizure activity.\nTherapeutic use of these drugs:\nGabapentin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia pain\nPregabalin: Focal seizures, postherpetic neuralgia pain, diabetic neuropathy pain, spinal cord injury pain, fibromyalgia pain.\n\n\n",

Amantadine increases the presynaptic release of dopamine and has agonist and modulatory action at postsynaptic D2 receptors.\nOption C: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic. Although this class of antipsychotics has a lower chance of causing NMS compared to typical antipsychotics, but cases of fatal NMS following the administration of quetiapine have been recorded.\nOptions B and D: Metoclopramide and domperidone are gastro kinetic agents with D2 antagonism.

Thus, agranulocytosis can happen at any plasma concentration of clozapine and concentration &lt; 350 ng/mL does not lower the risk.\nOption A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which acts by blocking the 5HT2, \uf0b0 2 and D4 receptors. The potency of block is D4 &gt; D2 &gt;D1.\nOption C: Concomitant administration of carbamazepine with clozapine is contraindicated because of the increased risk of leukopenia. In addition, carbamazepine is an enzyme inducer and reduces the half-life of clozapine.\nOption D: Administration of clozapine requires regular blood count monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis. Monitoring is performed weekly for the first 6 months and once in two weeks for the next 6 months. Patients must be asked to report for evaluation in case of symptoms such as fever or sore throat.

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 20:\n\nA 45-year-old woman suffering from Huntington's chorea is on haloperidol. Which of the following adverse drug effects is best attributed to the supersensitivity of dopamine receptors?\nMuscle rigidity, labile blood pressure, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tremors\nLip smacking, facial dyskinesia, protrusion and rolling of the tongue, involuntary movements of the extremities\nFacial grimacing, involuntary upward eye movement, laryngeal spasm and arching of the trunk forward\nStooped posture, rigidity, shuffling gait, bradykinesia, and pill rolling tremors\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 20:\nLip-smacking, facial dyskinesia, protrusion and rolling of the tongue, and involuntary movements of the extremities are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia. This is caused by supersensitivity of dopamine receptors.\nIt occurs as a consequence of chronic postsynaptic D2 receptor blockade by antipsychotics, which results in upregulation and supersensitivity of postsynaptic dopamine receptors.\nTardive dyskinesia is usually seen in patients treated with typical antipsychotics (first generation) for more than a year. This may be reversible with early recognition and drug discontinuation.\nTreatment is with valbenazine, deutetrabenazine (VMAT2 inhibitors).\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 21:\n\nA 24-year-old man is brought by his family with complaints of mental instability. On questioning, he says that he sees his grandparents in the room and talks to them often but the family confirms that it's been 10 years since his grandparents passed away.

Which of the\n\nfollowing antiviral drugs\u25a0 can be used for treating his condition?\nFoscarnet\nAcyclovi\nAmantadine\nInterferons\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nAmantadine is an antiviral agent that is the most commonly used medication for antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism.\nIt increases the concentration of dopamine (DA) at the synapse and appears to act by certain mechanisms like:\npresynaptic DA reuptake blockade\nfacilitation of DA release\npostsynaptic DA agonism\neceptor modulation\n\nThe guidelines recommend continuing the same antipsychotic, as switching the drug during pregnancy would cause a higher rate of relapse.\nAntipsychotic drugs and pregnancy:\nCrossing the placenta: Olanzapine &gt; Haloperidol &gt; Risperidone &gt; Quetiapine.\nOlanzapine is unlikely to increase the risk of birth defects above the background population risk. However, it can cause low birth weight and increased NICU admissions.\nClozapine is associated with gestational diabetes and neonatal seizures.\nNote: Although antipsychotic drugs appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy, the available data does not provide adequate guidance on the choice of agent. Because of limited experience in humans, olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only when the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n\nAnti-manic Drugs\n\n",

Which of the following investigations should be done to help diagnose her condition?\nSerum potassium level\nSerum lithium level\nECG\nM\u2022I\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe clinical features given in the question are most likely suggestive of lithium toxicity, and hence serum lithium levels should be measured to confirm it.\nLithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index and is the first line of management in bipolar disorder.\nThe kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way via ENac channel. Thus during fasting/dehydration, along with Na+ reabsorption in renal tubules, there will be an increase in the reabsorption of lithium leading to lithium toxicity.\nLithium has a very narrow therapeutic index of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. The severity of lithium toxicity is often divided into the following three grades:\nA fine tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses. Therapeutic lithium tremor is generally symmetric, limited to the arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithium toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity. Other adverse effects include mental confusion, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and edema.\nAs lithium is readily dialyzed, lithium overdose or toxicity is treated with hemodialysis.\n*Note - Serum Na+ levels are significant with respect to lithium toxicity, where as serum potassium levels becomes significant in digoxin toxicity. Hypokalemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity.\n\nGrade\nSr. lithium concentration(in mEq/L)\nSymptoms\nMild symptoms\n1.5-2.5\nnausea, vomiting,tremor, and fatigue\nModerate intoxicatio n\n2.5-3.5\nconfusion, agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and hypertonia\nSevere intoxication\n>3.5\ncoma,seizures, hyperthermia, and hypotension\n\n\n",

Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier because of the polar nature of the molecule. Levodopa is also a polar compound but it can cross the blood-brain barrier through an aromatic amino acid transporter.\nTherefore, levodopa is used therapeutically when dopamine is required for central action. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by the decarboxylase enzyme.\nCarbidopa is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor and does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\n",

Which is the first-line drug that can be prescribed for this patient?\nBenztropine\nGabapentin\n\nRiluzole\nClonazepam\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe symptoms in this patient are suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the first-line choice of treatment for this condition.\nRestless leg syndrome is a typical sensory-motor disorder that generally affects the legs during rest periods, especially sleep. There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated with burning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergic hypofunction is postulated.\nIn patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) are preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders.\nFDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:\nGabapentin\nRopinirole\nPramipexole\nRotigotine\nA dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder.\nOption A: Benztropine is an anticholinergic that can be used for drug-induced parkinsonism. Option C: Riluzole is a benzothiazole derivative that is used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nOption D: Benzodiazepines like clonazepam can be used as co-adjuvant drugs in the treatment of restless leg syndrome but should not be used as first-line therapy.\n\n\n",

Seizures and agitation may occur followed by depression.\nManagement of TCA overdose:\nInitial resuscitation by securing airway, breathing, and circulation.\nHypotension - IV fluids and norepinephrine infusion.\n\nCardiac-depressant effects - bolus dose of sodium bicarbonate helps overcome Na+ blockade by increasing extracellular Na+. It also addresses metabolic acidosis which is often present.\nArrhythmias - lignocaine for ventricular arrhythmias.\nSeizures - benzodiazepines like diazepam/lorazepam.\nPhysostigmine can reverse anticholinergic effects but can aggravate cardiac depression and cause seizures. Therefore physostigmine is not recommended.\n\n\n",

A proposed mechanism of escitalopram causing sexual dysfunction involves stimulation of the 5HT2C receptors.\n\n\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should be used carefully in the young for the management of depression due to increased suicidal ideation. In children and adolescents, there appears to be a slightly increased risk of suicidal ideations and attempts, but not of completed suicide.\nSomatic symptoms of depression improve faster than psychological symptoms when a patient is started on SSRIs and hence patients have the energy to act on their thoughts of deliberate\nself-harm and suicide (paradoxical suicide).\n\nOpioids - Functions and Classification\n\n",

Which of the following compounds would be responsible for this complication?\nTyramine\nTyrptophan\nThreonine\nThiamine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical presentation of a hypertensive crisis in a patient on MAO inhibitor therapy is suggestive of cheese reaction, which is seen after consumption of foods rich in tyramine (beer).\nTyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic. It induces the release of catecholamines from the neurons. Tyramine can be produced in high concentrations in protein-rich foods by decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation.\nNormally tyramine is inactivated when taken orally because it is readily metabolized by MAO in the liver. In patients who are on MAO inhibitor therapy, the tyramine taken in the diet is not inactivated and results in its increased sympathomimetic effect resulting in elevated blood pressure, termed as hypertensive crisis or cheese reaction. Drug of choice for cheese reaction is IV phentolamine.\nWhen MAO inhibitors are taken along with SSRI or TCA, it results in serotonin syndrome due to the overstimulation of 5HT receptors. The clinical features are a triad of:\nCognitive effect - delirium, coma\nAutonomic effects- hypertension, tachycardia\nSomatic effects- myoclonus, hyperreflexia, tremors\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This action is through interneurons that are involved in the gating of pain impulses.\nSupraspinal component: action at the medulla, periaqueductal gray matter, limbic, and cortical areas alter the processing and interpretation of pain impulses. It also sends inhibitory impulses through descending pathways to the spinal cord.\nPeripheral action: acts on small primary afferent terminals in the skin or deeper structures, decreasing their sensitization following tissue injury.\n\n\n",

Which of the following would you use as a substitute drug for maintenance therapy?\nMethylmorphine\nMethadone\nMeperidine\nMethylphenidate\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 10:\nMethadone is used as a substitute drug for the maintenance therapy of opioid (heroin)\ndependence. This is because of its good oral bioavailability and long half-life.\nMethadone is substituted for opioids during detoxification to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Once stabilized, the dose is gradually reduced and the drug is stopped slowly over days.\nDue to its long half-life and accumulation in tissues, discontinuing the drug still results in low concentrations of the drug in plasma resulting in protracted withdrawal symptoms.\n\nMaintainance therapy for opioid dependence:\nLong-acting opioid agonist - a safer substitute like methadone is given in a supervised manner to prevent withdrawal symptoms\nPartial agonist - buprenorphine can also be used\nClonidine, lofexidine - alpha-2 agonists act as sympatholytic and reduce the withdrawa symptoms\nLAAM(L-Alpha-Acetyl-Methadol) - opioid agonist which reduces craving\nNaltrexone - is an opioid antagonist used in maintenance therapy to prevent relapses\n\n\n",

What is the function of this drug in opioid addiction?\nPrevention of relapse\nTreatment of withdrawa\nTreatment of overdose\nPrevention of withdrawa\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nNaltrexone is used for the prevention of relapse in opioid addiction.\nIt is given only after initial opioid detoxification. The patient should be opioid-free for 7-10 days and have a negative naloxone challenge (no withdrawal after naloxone administration).\nNaltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist which is more potent than naloxone.

Raw: Question 12:\n\nWhich of the following is incorrect about the use of naltrexone in the treatment of opioid addiction?\nDiscontinuation of naltrexone does not cause withdrawal symptoms\nIt satisfies craving in opioid addicts\nIt blocks the effects of opioids if they are used\nIt is administered only when the patient has completed detoxification from opioids\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nNaltrexone does not satisfy the craving of opioid addicts. It is an opioid antagonist with a high affinity for \uf06d opioid receptors.\nNaltrexone does not suppress craving in opioid addiction but it suppresses craving in chronic alcoholics.\nOpioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine suppress craving and withdrawal symptoms and are therefore used in the first stage of detoxification in opioid addiction.\nOption A: Discontinuation of naltrexone ingestion has no negative physical consequences, as opposed to discontinuation of agonist maintenance therapies, which results in the emergence of opioid withdrawal symptoms. This is a major reason for noncompliance and treatment failure.\nOption C: It blocks the effects of opioids and prevents the user from experiencing subjective symptoms of opioid intoxication such as euphoria on subsequent use. As the user does not experience these symptoms, he does not develop a craving for the substance. Thus, naltrexone prevents relapse.\nOption D: It is only administered when the patient has completed a medically supervised detoxification from opioids because it can cause immediate withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\n\nDisulfiram cannot be used to treat heroin dependence.\n\nIt is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor used in the maintenance therapy of alcohol abstinence. Maintainance therapy for opioid dependence:\nLong-acting opioid agonist - a safer substitute like methadone is given in a supervised manner to prevent withdrawal symptoms\nPartial agonist - buprenorphine can also be used\nClonidine, lofexidine - alpha-2 agonists act as sympatholytic and reduce the withdrawal symptoms\nLAAM(L-Alpha-Acetyl-Methadol) - opioid agonist which reduces craving\nNaltrexone - is an opioid antagonist used in maintenance therapy to prevent relapses\n\nAlcohols\n\n",

Which of the following statements would be incorrect regarding his management?\nFomepizole is used intravenously\nIntravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole\nHemodialysis is not effective\nFolinic acid is also used in treatment\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical picture and labs are suggestive of accidental methanol toxicity. Hemodialysis is used in severe cases of methanol toxicity.\n\nA serum methanol concentration greater than 50 mg/dl is serious enough to consider hemodialysis. It can be used to remove both methanol and its toxic metabolite formic acid from the blood.\nOption A: Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, is administered intravenously in methanol toxicity. It acts by inhibiting the formation of formic acid.\nOption B: Intravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole. It has a higher affinity to alcohol dehydrogenase than methanol. Thus, saturation of ADH enzymes results in less formation of toxic formic acid.\nOption D: Folate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to CO2. Both folinic and folic acid are often administered during methanol toxicity but the exact benefit is yet to be determined.\nNote: Ethanol is given intravenously in the management of methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 11:\n\nWhich of the following antibacterial agents does not act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis?\nCarbapenems\nMonobactams\nCephalosporins\nNitrofurantoin\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nNitrofurantoin is an antibacterial drug that does not act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis.\nThe antibacterial activity of nitrofurantoin appears to correlate with the rapid intracellular conversion of nitrofurantoin to highly reactive intermediates by bacterial reductases. These intermediates react nonspecifically with many ribosomal proteins and disrupt the synthesis of proteins, RNA, DNA, and metabolic processes.\nCarbapenems, monobactams, and cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics that act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis.\n\n\n\nBacitracin acts on the cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of the cell wall.\nIt interferes with the dephosphorylation of bactoprenol (lipid carrier) which carries peptidoglycan subunits outside the cell membrane to the growing cell wall. It can also alter the integrity of the cell membrane.\nBacitracin is mainly active against gram-positive cocci and bacilli.\n\nAntimalarial Drugs\n\n",

It is associated with hypotension.\nQuinine is used in the treatment of drug-resistant and severe P. falciparum malaria. It acts against asexual erythrocytic forms but has no significant effect on hepatic forms of malarial parasites.\nOption A: Quinine use is associated with cinchonism which manifests as tinnitus, visual and auditory disturbances, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nOption B: Quinine has a stimulatory effect on pancreatic beta cells and can cause hypoglycemia.\nOption D: Blackwater fever is a rare type of hypersensitivity reaction to quinine. It presents with massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria that may lead to anuria, renal failure, and death.\n\n\n\nHemolysis in a G6PD deficient patient is more common with primaquine.\nG6PD deficient patients are highly sensitive to oxidative stress. They are at increased risk of hemolysis due to the oxidant property of primaquine. Therefore, before initiating primaquine therapy, the G6PD status of the patient has to be determined.

In all trimesters, pregnant women diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum infection can be treated with a combination of quinine and clindamycin.\nQuinine is considered the drug of choice in the first trimester. In the second and third trimesters artemether-lumefantrine can be used, but not in the first trimester.\nVivax malaria during pregnancy is treated with chloroquine as chloroquine is safe in pregnancy and children.\nClindamycin can be used in children for chloroquine-resistant cases. It is safe to use in children and pregnant women.\nOption B: Doxycycline is useful in the treatment of malaria but not used in pregnancy.\nOptions C and D: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is not recommended during the 1st trimester of pregnancy because of a lack of safety data.\n\n\n",

What is the probable diagnosis?\nAcute intermittent porphyria\nPorphyria cutanea tarda\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria\nHepatoerythropoietic porphyria\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given neurovisceral symptoms following the use of sulfonamides point towards a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).\nAIP is a rare heme biosynthesis disorder due to a partial deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Diagnosis is made based on elevated urine PBG levels. Alcohol, infections, pregnancy, and certain medications can trigger attacks by inducing heme synthesis. This results in the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, causing symptoms.\nSide effects of sulfonamides are:\nAcute intermittent porphyria - sulphonamides precipitate attacks\nHypersensitivity reaction - urticaria, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme of the Stevens-Johnson type, exfoliative dermatitis, and photosensitivity\n\nCrystalluria - due to low solubility. It is treated with good hydration and alkalization of urine\nHemolysis in G-6-PD deficiency (sulphonamides are oxidizers)\nKernicterus in the newborn (displace bilirubin)\n\n\n",

Therefore, renal failure decreases the clearance of the drug. Because the incidence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity is likely related to the overall exposure to aminoglycosides, it is critical to reduce the maintenance dose and dosing interval of these drugs in patients with impaired renal function.\nOption B: Renal clearances are increased and the half-life is reduced in cystic fibrosis patients necessitating higher doses.\nOption C: Burn patients have a more rapid drug clearance probably due to increased drug loss through burnt tissue and require higher doses in them.\nOption D: Aminoglycoside dose adjustment is not required in liver disease\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 7:\n\nA patient with hospital-acquired pneumonia is being treated with an aminoglycoside antibiotic by a single daily dose administration method. This method is preferred over the multiple daily dosage method because of which of the following properties of aminoglycosides?\nDecreased CYP450 mediated metabolism\nLong post antibiotic effect\nIncreased binding to plasma proteins\nTime dependent killin\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nSingle daily dose aminoglycoside administration is more preferable to multiple daily dose administration because of the long post-antibiotic effect.\nFor certain classes of drugs such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, its antimicrobial action is dependent on the peak concentration above MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). It is referred to as concentration-dependent killing.\nHigh-dose, extended-interval dosing schemes take advantage of the concentration-dependent activity of aminoglycosides to achieve maximal initial bacterial killing. And then because of the postantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides, good therapeutic response can be attained even when concentrations fall below MIC for a substantial fraction of the dosing interval.\nTherefore, a single daily dose would be equal to or more effective than multiple 8 hourly doses. This dosing strategy may also reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of these drugs.\n\nTime-dependent killing is an effect seen when the antimicrobial action is dependent on the duration, the drug concentration remains above the MIC. Beta-lactams, macrolides, and vancomycin have this property.\n\n\n",

Subsequently, he developed diarrhea and redistribution of body fat. What is false about the causative drug class?\nAtazanavir has the lowest propensity to increase total cholesterol levels.\nTipranavir is used in sub-therapeutic doses as a pharmacodynamic booster in cART.\nIndinavir can cause nephrolithiasis when adequate hydration is not maintained.\nRitonavir is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoform of P450 &amp; may alter levels of drugs.\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of adverse effects of gastrointestinal tolerance and fat redistribution due to protease inhibitors. HAART therapy includes this class of drugs along with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors +/- NNRTIs. Ritonavir, not tipranavir, is used in\nsub-therapeutic doses as a pharmacodynamic booster of other protease inhibitors in cART.\nThis is because ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoform of P450. It inhibits their CYP3A-mediated metabolism and permits the use of lower doses of other protease inhibitors. Nelfinavir is the only protease inhibitor not boosted by ritonavir.\nIndinavir is notable for its tendency to precipitate in the urinary tract, causing nephrolithiasis, unless the patient maintains a high state of hydration.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 24:\n\nAn AIDS patient on treatment with AZT, lamivudine, indinavir, ketoconazole, and cotrimoxazole, develops breast hypertrophy, central adiposity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and nephrolithiasis. Which of the following drugs could have caused these?\nAzidothymidine\nIndinavir\nKetoconazole\nLamivudine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 24:\nIndinavir, a protease inhibitor, is the most likely cause for these adverse effects.\nPatients being treated with protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir) develop a syndrome involving the derangement of lipid metabolism. This causes changes in body fat distribution. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has also been reported. This is called HIV/HAART-associated lipodystrophy.\nIndinavir can also precipitate in the urinary tract, causing nephrolithiasis, unless the patient is maintained in a high state of hydration.\nIndinavir binds to the site of HIV-1 protease activity and inhibits cleavage of viral gag-pol polyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious HIV. This results in the formation of immature, non-infectious viral particles.\nOption A: Azidothymidine or zidovudine, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Chronic zidovudine administration has been associated with nail hyperpigmentation.\nOption C: Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis. Its adverse effects include liver dysfunction and testosterone synthesis inhibition leading to gynecomastia.\nOption D: Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is one of the least toxic antiretroviral drugs. Neutropenia, headache, and nausea have been reported at\nhigher-than-recommended doses.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 25:\n\nWhich of the following is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in the treatment of HIV?\nBevacizumab\nIbalizumab\nPanitumumab\nPembrolizumab\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 25:\nIbalizumab is an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody approved for use in the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1. It is administered intravenously.\n\nIt acts as an entry inhibitor. It blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of CD4 cells. It also interferes with post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and thus prevents the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion.\n\n\n\nThe integrase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of HIV is raltegravir.\nIt inhibits the catalytic activity of the HIV-encoded integrase and prevents the integration of virus DNA into the host chromosome. It is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation by UGT1A1.\nThe other two FDA-approved integrase inhibitors are elvitegravir (EVG) and dolutegravir (DTG).\nOptions A and D: Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors. Option B: Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.\nNote: Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended as the preferred third drug for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis as per the recent MOHFW \u00f9an 2020 guideline, in line with WHO.\nThe FDA approved dolutegravir tablets and suspension for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg who have never been treated for HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase inhibitor class of drug.\nWHO recently recommended long-acting Cabotegravir, an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor may be offered as a HIV prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV infection. It is an IM injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis that has been shown to be highly effective at reducing the risk of HIV acquisition.

ESBL is most prevalent among gram-negative organisms like Klebsiella and E. coli.\nESBL can be inhibited by combining beta-lactamase inhibitors like clavulanic acid or tazobactam. Carbapenems and quinolones have inherent activity against ESBL.\nNote: As piperacillin has greater activity against Klebsiella and other gram-negative organisms than amoxicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam can be considered as a better option in this question.\n\n\n",

The \uf062-lactam antibiotics inhibit the last step in peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating the transpeptidase via cleavage of the \u2013CO\u2013N\u2013 bond of the \uf062-lactam ring. These transpeptidase targets are collectively called Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs)\nBeta-lactamases are enzymes produced by certain bacteria that inactivates \uf062-lactam antibiotics by hydrolysis of the \uf062-lactam ring in their structure.\nThe resistance to penicillins and other beta-lactam antibiotics can be conferred through one of the four mechanisms:\nInactivation of antibiotic by lactamases\nModification of target PBPs\nImpaired penetration of drug to target PBPs\nAntibiotic efflux\n\n\n",

Which of the following drugs might have caused this?\nPrednisolone\nSalbutamo\nFexofenadine\nAmoxicillin\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nSkin rashes of all types may be caused by allergy to penicillin.\nAmoxicillin and ampicillin are aminopenicillins. The incidence of skin rashes appears to be highest following the use of ampicillin, at about 9%.\nAmoxicillin is a close congener of ampicillin with the following features:\nBetter oral absorption; food does not interfere with the absorption\nIncidence of diarrhea is less\nMore active against penicillin-resistant pneumococci\n\nGentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as it has a narrow therapeutic index. It is nephrotoxic and ototoxic (predominantly vestibular effects).\nThe threshold for toxicity for gentamicin is the plasma concentration of 2 \uf06dg/mL, the maximum recommended for prolonged exposure.\nAminoglycoside antibiotics act by binding to the 30s ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis. Their ability to cause misreading of DNA templates and the formation of aberrant proteins that get incorporated into bacterial cell membranes makes them bactericidal agents.\nCommon ototoxic drugs are:\nAntibiotics - aminoglycosides (gentamicin &gt; tobramycin &gt; amikacin &gt; neomycin), erythromycin, tetracyclines.\nChemotherapeutic agents - cisplatin, bleomycin, nitrogen mustards.\nHigh dose aspirin, acetaminophen, NSAID\u2019s\nAntimalarials - quinine, quinidine\nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors - sildenafi\n\nCephalosporins, Vancomycin and Carbapenems\n",

Raw: Question 12:\n\nWhat is the mechanism of action of vancomycin?\nCell wall synthesis inhibition\nCell membrane inhibition\nPeptide synthesis inhibition\n50s ribosome inhibition\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe mechanism of action of vancomycin is cell wall synthesis inhibition.\nThe bacterial cell wall has long chains of peptidoglycan and is cross-linked to each other by the action of the enzyme transglycosylase. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide group of antibiotics that binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the synthesized peptidoglycan. This inhibits the transglycosylase enzyme and prevents elongation and cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This leads to the weakening of the cell wall causing lysis.\nIt exhibits a time-dependant or concentration-independent killing of bacteria. It primarily acts on Gram +ve organisms which are resistant to other antibiotics such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus and ampicillin resistant enterococci.\nLipoglycopeptides are a new generation of glycopeptide congeners which include telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin. Dalbavancin and Oritovancin are administered as a single intravenous dose for skin and soft-tissue infections.\n\n\n\n\n",

The most appropriate treatment is intravenous metronidazole.\nThe amoebic ulcer which is flask-shaped is the typical lesion seen in intestinal amoebiasis. The ulcers are multiple and are confined to the colon. Sometimes, in secondary intestinal lesions, the ulcers are numerous in the cecum, followed by the sigmoido-rectal region.\nThree classes of drugs are used in the treatment of amebiasis:\nLuminal amoebicides- diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, paromomycin, and tetracycline. They act in the intestinal lumen but not in tissues.\nTissue amoebicides- emetine and chloroquine. They are effective in systemic infection but less effective in the intestine.\nBoth luminal and tissue amebicides- Metronidazole, tinidazole and imidazole.

The drug of choice is oral terbinafine which acts by inhibition of ergosterol synthesis.\nTerbinafine acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, an early step enzyme in the synthesis of fungal ergosterol. This results in the accumulation of sterol squalene which is toxic to the organism.\nThe efficacy of terbinafine in onychomycosis is improved when combined with amorolfine 5% nail lacquer.\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 3:\n\nA patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and was started on first-line antitubercular drugs. Which of the following drug acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the marked layer shown in the image?\n\n\n\nIsoniazid\nRifampicin\nPyrazinamide\nEthambuto\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nIsoniazid is the first-line antitubercular drug that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid.\nIsoniazid is a first-line bactericidal drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This drug enters bacilli by passive diffusion. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme\ncatalase-peroxidase(the enzyme encoded by the Kat gene).\nNormally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the reactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with NAD that inhibit InhA and KasA. Hence, isoniazid inhibits the production of mycolic acid.\nThe reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with NADP. This complex inhibits mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of DNA synthesis.\nSide effects of isoniazid include:\nPeripheral neuritis due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxa phosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, pyridoxine 10mg/day (vitamin B6) is given prophylactically along with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity.\nHepatitis - isoniazid must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity.\nRashes\nAnaemia\nArthralgia\nToxicity of isoniazid results in metabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma. Other options:\nOption B: Rifampin acts by binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form a stable drug-enzyme complex. This complex suppresses RNA synthesis. Side effects of rifampin are hepatitis, flu-like illness, orange-red colored urine, and body secretions.\nOption C: Pyrazinamide is a prodrug, it is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acid which makes the intracellular environment acidic and collapses the transmembrane proton motive force, thereby killing the bacteria. Side effects include hyperuricemia and hepatotoxicity.\nOption D: Ethambutol inhibits arabinose transferase III, thereby decreasing arabinogalactan biosynthesis. This results in disruption in mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. Optic neuritis is an\n\nimportant side effect of ethambutol. It results in decreased visual acuity and loss of red-green discrimination.\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 4:\n\nA study was conducted to genotype NAT2 gene polymorphisms in patients receiving ATT. Among the 300 patients genotyped, 200 were slow acetylators (group A), 70 were intermediate (group B) and 30 were fast acetylators (group C). Patients in group A are prone to develop which of the following?\nFailure of therapy\nPeripheral neuropathy\nHepatotoxicity\nAllergic reactions\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 4:\nIsoniazid, a key agent in the ATT, is metabolized primarily through N-acetylation by the genetically polymorphic N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) enzyme. Slow acetylators (group A) of isoniazid are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy.\nThe rate of metabolism of isoniazid is determined by the genetic polymorphism of NAT2 enzyme and classified broadly into two groups - slow and fast acetylators.\nIn slow acetylators, the drug accumulates due to slow metabolism resulting in an increased risk of side effects, and hence they should undergo periodic monitoring. Peripheral neuropathy is a more frequent side effect of INH when compared to hepatotoxicity.\nFast acetylators metabolize the drug rapidly and show less response to standard doses and the therapy may be less effective.\n\n\n",

ETH is not a first-line agent due to its gastrointestinal side effects. It is structurally related to thionamides (propylthiouracil and methimazole) and therefore causes hypothyroidism by preventing organification of iodine in thyroid hormone synthesis. Another antitubercular drug that can cause hypothyroidism is Para-amino salicylic acid (PAS).\nETH/PAS-induced hypothyroidism should be treated with thyroxine replacement therapy, instead of changing the regimen. Thyroid function usually optimizes within 2 months after completing MDR therapy.\n\n\n",

What would your advice be regarding levothyroxine?\nSwitch to liothyronine as levothyroxine is teratogenic\nIncrease the dose as pregnancy causes an increased demand for levothyroxine\nContinue the same dose but monitor the serum levels on a fortnightly basis\nStop levothyroxine till the end of the first trimester as it has teratogenic potential\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe dose of levothyroxine in patients who become pregnant should usually be increased. This is because demand for levothyroxine increases in pregnancy and low thyroxine levels are associated with adverse fetal outcomes such as mental retardation.\nThe dose of levothyroxine is increased by 30-50% by asking the patient to take 2 extra pills per week. Increased demand for levothyroxine in pregnancy is due to:\nThe increased serum concentration of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) induced by estrogen\nIncreased expression of type 3 deiodinase in the placenta\nA small amount of passage of levothyroxine to the fetus\nThyroid hormones are not teratogenic. Liothyronine is not preferred in pregnancy because T3 has a short half-life and requires frequent dosing to limit large fluctuations in levels. In addition, excess T3 often acts to normalize TSH while lowering T4, thereby risking inadequate T4 availability to the fetus.\n\n\n",

Which of the following is the drug of choice for the treatment of her condition?\nMethimazole\nCarbimazole\nPropylthiouracil\nRadioactive iodine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe drug of choice for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis during the first trimester of pregnancy is propylthiouracil (PTU). It is because it has lower teratogenic effects than carbimazole or methimazole.\nCarbimazole and methimazole are associated with teratogenic effects such as:\nAplasia cutis congenita\nChoanal atresia\nTreacheosopageal fistula\nFetal goiter\nHowever, propylthiouracil use is limited to the first trimester due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It is replaced with carbimazole or methimazole in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of the pregnancy.\nThe lowest effective antithyroid drug dose should be used throughout gestation.

This occurs in the thyroid gland which is under pituitary control.\nWith persistent high iodine load, an escape phenomenon occurs in normal individuals after around 10 days as the iodide levels fall inside the follicle. In autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto\u2019s or Grave\u2019s), however, the suppression may persist.\n\nThe Jod-Basedow phenomenon is iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. It is also seen after an iodine load. However, it is seen in thyroid glands where autoregulation and pituitary control have failed. When exposed to an iodine load in excess, instead of blocking the organification process, the thyroid gland (areas of the autonomously functioning gland) continues to uptake the iodine, producing more thyroid hormone independent of normal regulatory mechanisms. It is seen in endemic goiter, toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, and sometimes in Grave\u2019s disease.\n\n\n",

It converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone.\nCortisol is active and can bind to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors whereas cortisone is inactive and does not bind to either. The selective inactivation of cortisol is required in certain sites such as the distal nephron so that the specific autoregulatory responses to aldosterone can be achieved.\nTherefore, cortisol (active) is metabolized to cortisone (inactive) by 11-beta-HSD2 in the kidney, so as to protect renal mineralocorticoid receptors from cortisol binding. Some tissues, like the liver, can convert inactive cortisone back to active cortisol through an enzyme called 11-beta-HSD1 (\"B\" in the image). This completes the \u201ccortisone\u2013cortisol shuttle\u201d because the kidney can inactivate cortisol where it is not needed and the liver can reactivate it afterward.\n\n\n\nHowever, when circulating cortisol levels are very high, as in severe Cushing syndrome, they can overwhelm this protective mechanism, allowing cortisol to bind to and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor. This leads to volume expansion, hypertension, and hypokalemia often observed in hypercortisolism. A mutation of 11-beta-HSD2 also causes a similar clinical picture and is the reason for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess.\n17\uf062-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3\uf062-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are involved in the metabolism of sex steroids.\n\n\n",

It results in weight loss.\nIt acts by inhibiting the SGLT2 (sodium glucose-2) transporter, which is present on the proximal segment of the renal tubule and responsible for the reabsorption of 80-90% of filtered glucose. It inhibits glucose reabsorption resulting in glycosuria and a decrease in blood glucose level. It is effective orally.\nThe common adverse effects include urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections due to the high glucose content of the urine and also the high risk of fractures.\nOther SGLT2 inhibitors include empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin.\nNote: Empagliflozin has been found to decrease the risk of mortality from cardiovascular causes in diabetic patients.

It depends on its clearance and volume of distribution.\nt1/2 = 0.693 x Vd/Cl where,\nVd - volume of distribution\nCl - clearance.\nWe can take 0.693 approximately as 0.7 Substituting,\nt1/2 = 0.7 x 40 /0.2\nt1/2 = 0.7 x 200\nt1/2 = 140 minutes\nClinical implications: Half-life determines the duration of the drug effect. It also indicates whether the accumulation of the drug will occur under multiple dosage regimens thereby making it is essential to decide on the appropriate dosing interval.\n\n\n\nPlasma steady-state concentration is achieved when the amount of drug being administered equals the amount of drug being excreted from the body.\nThe amount of drug being administered = 1.6mg/min\nAmount of drug being excreted = Clearance (CL) x Plasma concentration of the drug (C)\nClearance = 640ml/min Therefore,\n1.6mg/min = 640ml /min ( clearance) x Plasma concentration of the drug Hence,\nPlasma concentration of the drug = 1.6 mg/min / 640 ml/min = 0.002 mg/ml.\n\nANS Introduction & Parasympathomimetics\n",

In the given question,\n20mg out of 200mg is excreted in 90 minutes, 20/200 = 0.1 fraction is eliminated every 90 minutes.

Following surgery, he developed short bowel syndrome and has been on parenteral nutrition. Which of the following drugs would be beneficial for his condition?\nLiraglutide\nLixisenatide\nTeduglutide\nSemaglutide\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nTeduglutide is a GLP-2 analog and is approved for the treatment of short bowel syndrome.\nGLP-2 binds to enteric neurons and endocrine cells, stimulating the release of a number of hormones such as insulin-like growth factor. This stimulates mucosal epithelial growth and enhances fluid absorption.\nGLP-1 analogs:\nExenatide\nLiraglutide\nAlbiglutide\nDulaglutide\nLixisenatide\nSemaglutide\nNote: GLP-1 analogs are used for the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus.\n\nTeduglutide can potentially cause bowel cancer, therefore it is not recommended for patients with active malignancies.\nIt is a GLP-2 analog that has been recently approved for the treatment of short bowel syndrome. It inhibits gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying, stimulates mucosal epithelial growth\nand intestinal blood flow, and enhances nutrient and fluid absorption\nThe drug has a t1/2 of 1\u20132 hours and is administered subcutaneously once daily.

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 2:\n\nA 28-year-old nurse was brought to the casualty with seizures and altered mental status. Her plasma glucose was 35 mg/dl. Which test would help to rule out the possibility of exogenous insulin administration?\nGlucagon\nC-peptide\nPancreatic polypeptide\nPreproinsulin\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 2:\nC-peptide can be used to rule out the possibility of factitious hypoglycemia resulting from exogenously administered insulin.\nEndogenous insulin is initially synthesized as preproinsulin that is processed to proinsulin inside beta cells. Proinsulin is released by secretory granules after processing it to form insulin and\nC-peptide.\nSynthetic insulin usually lacks C-peptide, so in factitious hypoglycemia secondary to exogenous insulin administration, plasma insulin will be elevated, but there will be suppression of C-peptide and proinsulin, and insulin to C-peptide ratio will be greater than one.\nOn the other hand, insulinomas and insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas stimulate endogenous insulin production. As a result, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels will be all elevated. The only way to differentiate between insulinoma and insulin\nsecretagogues-induced hypoglycemia is by detecting the drug, e.g., sulfonylurea, in the blood or urine.\n\nC-peptide has no known physiological function or receptor. It has a half-life of about 30 min.\n\n\n",

What is the clinical concern associated with administering insulin alone?\nHypokalemia\nHypernatremia\nHyperkalemia\nHyponatremia\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\n\nDeep breathing (Kussmaul respiration) and fruity breath (acetone odor) in a symptomatic patient with type 1 diabetes are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis. Insulin therapy alone in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may result in hypokalemia.\nDKA is usually associated with a major K+ deficit. Potassium loss is caused by an extracellular shift of potassium (in exchange with hydrogen ions) due to acidosis. Much of the shifted extracellular potassium is lost due to emesis and osmotic diuresis.\nWhen insulin therapy is initiated for DKA, the serum K+ is shifted intracellularly. Dangerous hypokalemia might occur if K+ supplementation is not initiated subsequently. Insulin should be withheld if the serum level of potassium is below 3.3 mmol/L.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 3:\n\nA 32-year-old multipara at 40 weeks gestation developed water intoxication and hyponatremia following prolonged IV infusion with oxytocin by an inexperienced junior resident. This adverse effect is due to oxytocin's action on which of the following sites?\nVasopressin V2 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells\nVasopressin V2 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells\nVasopressin V1 receptors on serosal surface of renal tubular cells\nVasopressin V1 receptors on luminal surface of renal tubular cells\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nOxytocin can bind to V2 receptors on the serosal surface of renal tubular cells resulting in reduced free water clearance.\nThis is because oxytocin and vasopressin have structural similarities. Oxytocin can have vasopressin (ADH) like activity at V2 receptors. The increase in water permeability occurs through the insertion of aquaporins (water channels) in collecting tubules.\nProlonged i.v. administration at high doses in conjunction with large volumes of hypotonic fluid may cause water intoxication associated with hyponatremia.\n\nTo avoid this complication, whenever high doses of oxytocin are administered over a long time:\nAn electrolyte-containing diluent must be used (not dextrose)\nThe volume of infused fluid should be kept low (by infusing oxytocin at a higher concentration)\nFluid intake must be restricted, fluid balance chart should be kept and serum electrolytes shoul be monitore\n\n\n",

She does not have any symptoms at the moment. Which of the following should you administer to her?\nFlumazeni\nN-acetylcysteine\nMethylene blue\nNothing as she is asymptomatic\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe patient in the given clinical scenario has ingested a potentially toxic dose of acetaminophen. N-acetylcysteine is considered as a definitive antidote for acetaminophen poisoning to prevent hepatic injury.\nN-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is a toxic metabolite of acetaminophen which causes hepatotoxicity. In adults, hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of 10\u201315 g (150\u2013250 mg/kg) of acetaminophen; doses of 20\u201325 g or more are potentially fatal.\n\nIn acetaminophen poisoning, due to increased NAPQI, there is utilization of glutathione (GSH).\nThis in turn leads to depletion of GSH leading to oxidative cellular damage of the hepatocytes. N-acetylcysteine replenishes GSH stores and also conjugates with NAPQI and prevents oxidative damage to the cell. It also protects against extrahepatic injury due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\nOption A: Flumazenil is an antidote for benzodiazepine toxicity. Option C: Methylene blue is used in methemoglobinemia.\nOption D: Symptoms may take upto 2 days to develop in a case of acetaminophen poisoning by which time the hepatic damage may become irreversible.

Which of the following statements is true regarding this drug?\nIt causes renal toxicity\nIt is more likely to cause gastric ulcers compared to ibuprofen\nIt is not associated with cardiotoxicity\nIt has antiplatelet action\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nCelecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. As COX-2 enzyme is constitutively active within the kidney, recommended doses of selective COX-2 inhibitors cause renal toxicities similar to those associated with traditional NSAIDs.\nOption B - It is less likely to cause gastric ulcers. Celecoxib has analgesic, antipyretic, and\nanti-inflammatory effects similar to those of non-selective NSAIDs but with better gastrointestinal tolerability.\nOption C - It inhibits COX-2-mediated prostacyclin synthesis in the vascular endothelium. As a result, use of celecoxib is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.\n\nOption D - Celecoxib at usual doses does not inhibit platelet aggregation. This is because platelet aggregation is mediated by thromboxane produced by the COX-1.\nThese points are also true for other selective COX-2 inhibitors.\n\n\n",

Colchicine is poorly tolerated and should not be used in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease.\nIndomethacin is commonly used in the initial treatment of gout. In addition to inhibiting prostaglandin synthase, indomethacin and other NSAIDs also inhibit urate crystal phagocytosis\nIntraarticular steroids like triamcinolone or methylprednisolone can also be given.\nAspirin is not used because it causes renal retention of uric acid at low doses. It is uricosuric only at higher doses that are poorly tolerated.\n\n\n\nErenumab-aooe is a calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for the prophylaxis of migraine.\nThe pathology of migraine is not completely understood but it includes activation of trigeminal ganglion nociceptive neurons and the subsequent release of CGRP from fibers associated with meningeal vessels. This is believed to mediate vasodilation and mast cell degranulation. Thus, CGRP is involved in the development and maintenance of persistent pain, central sensitization and allodynia, which are events characteristic of migraine pathology.\nBlockage of CGRP receptors by CGRP receptor antagonists, causes inhibition of the inflammatory and nociceptive effects of CGRP at multiple sites within the peripheral and central nervous systems that are implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine.\nMonoclonal antibodies that directly inhibit CGRP have also been developed. These include:\nFremanezumab\nGalcanezumab Note:\nThe FDA has recently approved Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. The recommended dosage is 10 mg, 30 mg, or 60 mg orally once daily. In severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease it is 10 mg once daily.\n\nAnti-rheumatoid drugs\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 2:\n\nA middle-aged woman with rheumatoid arthritis was on DMARD therapy with a drug that increases extracellular adenosine. Which drug was she likely on?\nMethotrexate\nLefunamide\nSulphasalazine\nHydroxychloroquine\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 2:\nMethotrexate is the DMARD that increases extracellular adenosine.\nIt is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor that leads to purine synthesis inhibition and this is cytotoxic to lymphocytes.\nIt also inhibits amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase. This leads to increased extracellular adenosine which is\nanti-inflammatory.\nThe increased extracellular adenosine is hepatotoxic and hence monitoring with LFT is needed every 2-3 months.\n\n\n\n\n",

What drug can be administered to alleviate this side effect?\n\n\nAscorbic acid\nCyanocobalamin\nThiamine\nFolinic acid\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe peripheral smear findings point to a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. Folinic acid is given with methotrexate to decrease its side effects.\nMethotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor and thus can lead to a deficiency of folic acid which may present as megaloblastic anemia.\nFolinic acid/leucovorin calcium/citrovorum factor is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. Thus, it decreases the side effects caused due to folate deficiency.\n\n\n",

H3 receptor agonists decrease the release of histamine and have actions similar to that of antihistamines.\nNormally, histamine increases gastric secretion by acting through the H2 receptor in the stomach. H3 receptor agonist decreases histamine release and hence, decreases\nH2 receptor-mediated gastric secretion.\nOptions A and C: H1 receptor stimulation by histamine in the CNS causes wakefulness, and at\nthe bronchus causes bronchoconstriction. Therefore H3 receptor agonists by decreasing histamine release inhibit H1 receptor-induced wakefulness and bronchoconstriction.\nOption D: H3 receptors are also presynaptic heteroreceptors on various neurons and their activation can decrease noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and glutaminergic transmission. A decrease in noradrenergic transmission in atria can result in a negative chronotropic effect.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 12:\n\nA first-year anesthesia resident administered neostigmine to a patient who was accidentally given a slightly excessive bolus dose of suxamethonium. What is the most probable effect this\n\nis likely to produce?\nComplete reversal\nIncomplete reversal\nNo effect\nEnhanced relaxation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nNeostigmine prolongs the muscle relaxation caused by suxamethonium (succinylcholine) instead of reversing the block.\nThe contraction of a muscle is achieved by a cycle of ACh binding and its\ndegradation. Depolarising neuromuscular blockers (such as suxamethonium) acts by binding to the receptors much longer than ACh and causing a prolonged depolarization, resulting in an eventual blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis.\n\nAChE metabolizes ACh and plasma cholinesterase metabolizes suxamethonium (SCh). Neostigmine blocks both enzymes. By inhibiting AChE, neostigmine increases the ACh concentration in the synaptic cleft. But this cannot reverse the block as the depolarized nerves are unresponsive to any stimuli during this period. However, the simultaneous inhibition of plasma cholinesterase decreases the degradation of SCh and therefore potentiates the neuromuscular block of suxamethonium, resulting in prolonged muscle relaxation.\nNeostigmine can be used only as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade caused by competitive non-depolarising blockers such as vecuronium.\n\n\n\n",

The organophosphates bind to the esteratic (active) site of AChEs (acetylcholine esterases) and deactivate it.\nThis results in excessive Ach causing increased muscarinic activity like increased tracheobronchial and salivary secretions, bronchoconstriction, miosis, bradycardia, and to a lesser extent peripheral ganglionic and CNS actions. It has relatively insignificant action on nicotinic receptors.\nAtropine antagonizes these parasympathetic effects by competitive inhibition of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors.\nPralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied. Then it reacts with the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorous compound which is attached to the esteric site to form a phospho-oxime complex.

Raw: Question 7:\n\nWhat is the mechanism by which acetylcholine causes a decrease in the heart rate?\nDelayed diastolic depolarization\nIncrease in plateau\nDecrease in preload\nIncrease in afterload\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe mechanism by which acetylcholine causes a decrease in the heart rate is by decreasing the diastolic depolarization.\n\nThe acetylcholine released from the vagal nerve acts on the M2 receptor (\uf062\uf067 subunit of G protein) on the SA node. This opens a special set of potassium channels causing an efflux of potassium (IKAch) which hyperpolarizes the SA node (Ih). The resultant current (Ih) slows the diastolic depolarization thereby causing bradycardia.\n\n\n",

They bind to antithrombin and accelerates the rate at which it inhibits various coagulation proteases, especially thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa.\nLMWH has some action against thrombin.

This results in the activation of platelets to propagate a hypercoagulable state culminating in life-threatening thrombosis.\nIt is characterized by thrombocytopenia (Platelet count &lt;1,00,000/\uf06dL or reduced by over 50% from pre-treatment value) and clinically presents as venous thrombosis (in the form\nof DVT or pulmonary embolism)\nIt occurs around 5-10 days after starting heparin.

Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as argatroban is the anticoagulant of choice in HIT.\nManagement of HIT:\nStop heparin/LMWH\nGive an alternative anticoagulant, such as lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux or rivaroxaban\nDo not give platelet transfusions (it only worsens the consumptive coagulopathy)\n\nDo not give warfarin until the platelet count returns to its baseline level. If warfarin was administered, give vitamin K to restore the INR to normal.\nIncreased thrombin generation associated with HIT can cause consumption of protein C.

Drugs that are bound to plasma proteins are lost in the urine. Similarly, warfarin is lost in urine in nephrotic syndrome, resulting in a decreased effect.\n\nOption C: Warfarin is mainly metabolized by the CYP2C9 enzyme. In patients being treated with metronidazole (a CYP2C9 inhibitor), the metabolism of warfarin is decreased. Hence, the effect of warfarin is increased.\nOptions B and D: Hepatic impairment, congestive heart failure, and hyperthyroidism lead to low concentrations of clotting factors and thus the effect of warfarin is enhanced in these conditions.\n\n\n",

Which of the following can be used to monitor the treatment in this patient?\nProthrombin time\nActivated partial thromboplastin time\nBleeding time\nClotting time\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 31:\nWarfarin therapy is usually monitored by measuring prothrombin time.\nProthrombin time is sensitive to the reduction in levels of prothrombin, factor VII, and factor X. The test is performed by adding thromboplastin, which is a reagent containing tissue factor, phospholipid and calcium to citrated plasma and determining the time to clot formation.\nDue to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastin, the International normalized ratio (INR) was developed to standardize the reporting of prothrombin time. In INR, the patient\u2019s prothrombin time is divided by mean normal prothrombin time and this ratio is multiplied by the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the particular thromboplastin reagent.\nWarfarin therapy should be monitored with INR every 3\u20134 weeks. The target INR is 2.0\u20133.0. In patients with mechanical heart valves, the target INR is 2.5\u20133.5.\n\n\n",

Factor VII may be included or produced separately.\nOption D: Vitamin K1 is the specific antidote for warfarin-induced bleeding, but it takes 6-24 hours for the clotting factors to be resynthesized and released in blood after Vitamin K administration and hence its action is delayed for several hours.\nOption A: Cryoprecipitate mainly contains factor VIII and fibrinogen and therefore is not suitable for warfarin-induced bleeding, as warfarin inhibits factors II, VII, IX, X.\n\nOption B: Fresh frozen plasma can also be used but prothrombin complex concentrate normalizes the INR more rapidly.\n\n\n",

This occurs due to:\nLow ATIII levels (most common cause)\nIncreased heparin-binding plasma proteins (acute phase reactants)\nIncreased heparin clearance (e.g. due to splenomegaly in liver disease)\nLow ATIII levels could be due to decreased synthesis (hereditary, hepatic failure), increased consumption (DIC, MAHA, or in a bypass circuit) or increased loss (nephrotic syndrome).\nThe dose of heparin has to be increased to achieve therapeutic aPTT.

It binds to acidic heparin with high affinity and neutralizes anticoagulant activity. The resultant protamine-heparin complexes are cleared. Protamine binds only to long heparin molecules (UFH). Therefore, protamine only partially reverses the activity of LMWH and has no effect on fondaparinux.\nIt is most commonly used to neutralize heparin-induced anticoagulation after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. It is also utilized in the setting of dialysis, invasive vascular procedures, and acute ischemic strokes.\nNote: Protamine sulfate has anticoagulant activity at higher doses and hence, only small amounts of protamine (1mg/100 units of heparin) are used for heparin-induced bleeding.\n\n\n",

You attach the device shown below to the pressurized metered-dose inhaler for ease of use. Which of the following is false about this device?\n\n\nDecreases the deposition of drug on the oropharynx\nIncreases the delivery of drug to lower airways\nIncreases the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis\nSystemic absorption of drugs is unaffected\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given image is of a spacer device. It decreases the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other propellant-mediated oropharyngeal adverse effects like dysphonia that occur with the use of a pMDI.\nSpacers reduce the velocity and size of particles entering the upper airways. This reduces the amount of drug that impinges on the oropharynx and increases the proportion of drug inhaled into lower airways. The systemic absorption is unchanged by the use of a spacer.\nSpacer devices are useful in delivering inhaled drugs to children who are not able to use a pMDI alone but can also be used by adults for better drug delivery. The image below shows the use of a spacer device with a face mask which is preferred in children younger than 3 years of age.\n\n\nThe various devices used for the delivery of inhalational drugs are:\nPressurized metered-dose inhalers - Drugs are propelled from a canister in the pMDI with the aid of a propellant. These devices are convenient, portable, and typically deliver 50\u2013200 doses of a\n\ndrug\n\n\nDry powder inhalers - these devices scatter the drug into a fine powder that is dispersed by air turbulence on inhalation. DPIs have been developed to deliver drugs such as insulin, but the dosing is inconsistent. Children &lt;7 years find it difficult to use a DPI.\n\n\nNebulizers: Two types of nebulizer are available -\nJet nebulizers that are driven by a stream of gas (air or oxygen)\nUltrasonic nebulizers that use a rapidly vibrating piezoelectric crystal and thus do not require a source of compressed gas.\nThe nebulizers deliver much higher drug doses as compared pMDIs. These are useful in:\nTreating acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD\nExtreme airway obstruction (severe COPD)\n\nDelivering inhaled drugs to infants and small children who cannot use the other inhalation devices\nAdministering drugs such as antibiotics in relatively high doses\n\n\n\n",

On which of the following receptors does this drug have an antagonistic action?\nHistamine receptors\nBradykinin receptors\nAdenosine receptors\nKallikrein receptors\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nTheophylline has an antagonistic action on adenosine receptors.\nTheophylline is a methylxanthine. It acts as a non-selective PDE inhibitor. Its other actions include:\nIncreased IL-10 release\nDecrease in gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines\nPromotes apoptosis of granulocytes\nHistone deacetylase activation. The recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 by glucocorticoid receptors switches off inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism, theophylline enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.\nTheophylline can be used as a bronchodilator in an asthmatic patient on ICS as an add-on drug. LABAs are more effective but theophylline is a cheaper option.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 8:\n\nWhich proton pump inhibitor should be avoided in a patient on warfarin anticoagulation?\nRabeprazole\nPantoprazole\nLansoprazole\nOmeprazole\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nOmeprazole should not be used in a patient on warfarin therapy as it decreases the metabolism of warfarin.\nAll PPIs are metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochromes, including CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and may interfere with the metabolism of the other drugs. It inhibits the metabolism of clopidogrel, diazepam, and phenytoin.\nNote: There is disagreement among different authors regarding the PPIs and their interactions with the metabolism of other drugs.\nGoodman and Gilman mention that lansoprazole and rabeprazole along with omeprazole and esomeprazole interact with the metabolism of warfarin.\nKatzung and various online sources agree that lansoprazole and rabeprazole do not or minimally interact with warfarin metabolism.\nAll of them agree that pantoprazole does not or minimally interacts with warfarin metabolism.\n\n\n",

Since allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, it causes elevated levels of 6-MP. Hence, the oral dose of 6MP needs to be reduced by 75 % if allopurinol is given.\nIn the case of intravenous administration, the dosage need not be changed as it escapes the first-pass metabolism.\n\n\n",

During the cycles, he had developed tingling and numbness in the lower limbs and the symptoms progressed even after cessation of the cycles. Which drug could have led to this?\nCisplatin\nPaclitaxe\nMitomycin\nVincristine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe scenario depicts coasting effect neuropathy, which is seen with cisplatin.\nThe coasting effect means the progression of symptoms even after the cessation of the drug. Neurotoxicity is usually dependent on the cumulative dose of anticancer drugs. The severity of neuropathy increases with the duration of treatment and progression stops once drug treatment is completed.\nPlatinum compounds are an exception, where sensory loss progresses for several months after cessation of treatment. The coasting effect is more common with cisplatin and oxaliplatin than with carboplatin.\n\n\n",

Which of the following drugs could have caused this condition?\nVinblastine\nPaclitaxe\nCisplatin\nBleomycin\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe scenario is suggestive of secondary leukemia which is associated with cisplatin. Cisplatin is a platinum-containing anticancer agent that forms DNA adduct. It is associated with the development of AML usually more than 4 years after treatment.\nProcarbazine, a methylhydralazine (alkylating agent), is most commonly associated with the development of leukemias with a 5-10% risk of acute leukemia in patients treated with the MOPP regimen.\nCisplatin produces responses in cancers of the bladder, head and neck, cervix, and endometrium; all forms of carcinoma of the lung; anal and rectal carcinomas; and neoplasms of childhood.\n\n\n",

Which drug could it be?\nCisplatin\nStreptozocin\nMethysergide\nCyclophosphamide\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe given scenario is suggesstive of nephrotoxicity and it is one of the dose-limiting toxicity of cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin achieves a high concentration in nephrons. Both direct toxicity and inflammation are responsible for nephrotoxicity. A high concentration of chloride stabilizes cisplatin and reduces nephrotoxicity. Therefore, chloride diuresis is used to reduce nephrotoxicity.\nOption B - Streptozotocin use can result in diabetes mellitus due to the destruction of beta cells of the pancreas.\nOption C - Methysergide use is associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis.\nOption D - Cyclophosphamide causes hemorrhagic cystitis as one of its characteristic side effect.\n",

The main abnormality in bleomycin toxicity occurs in endothelial and epithelial cells. This leads to the destruction and desquamation of type I pneumocytes and the resultant hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes.\nPulmonary toxicity begins with a dry cough, fine rales, and diffuse basal infiltrates on X-ray and may progress to life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis. No specific treatment is available to ameliorate the toxicity and managed by general symptomatic care.\nNote: Few case reports of methotrexate causing pulmonary fibrosis are reported.

The recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) preparation that is approved for use in metastatic melanoma is aldesleukin. It acts as an IL-2 agonist and is also approved for use in metastatic renal cell cancer.\nDenileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin made from the recombinant combination of IL-2 and the catalytically active fragment of diphtheria toxin. It is approved for use in cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\nImatinib and nilotinib are a BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n\n\nDenileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin made from the genetic recombination of IL-2 and the catalytically active fragment of diphtheria toxin.\nIt is indicated for advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with &gt;20% of T cells expressing the surface marker CD25. After binding to the IL-2 receptors, it is internalized by endocytosis. The active fragment of diphtheria toxin then is released into the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation, leading to cell death.\nImmunotoxins are proteins that contain a toxin along with an antibody that binds specifically to target cells.\nAntibody-drug conjugates are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologically active cytotoxic (anticancer) drug. These antibody-targeted drug therapies are cell-specific to kill efficiently the target cells that bind and internalize the drug conjugate. Examples are:\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin - Monoclonal antibody against CD33 linked to a semisyntheti derivative of calicheamicin, a potent antitumor antibiotic. It was approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.\nBrentuximab vedotin - Anti-CD30 IgG1 monoclonal antibody linked with the\nmicrotubule-disrupting agent MMAE. It is used for the treatment of Hodgkin and anaplasti lymphoma.\nAdo-trastuzumab emtansine - It combines the HER2-targeted properties of trastuzumab with the antimicrotubule agent DM1 (derived from maytansine), allowing preferential intracellular drug delivery to HER2+ cells. It is used in the treatment of HER+ breast cancer.",

What is the mechanism resulting in the loss of response?\n\nAmplification of wild-type kinase gene\nIncreased efflux\nPoint mutations in kinase domain\nOverexpression of MDR gene\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of the development of resistance to imatinib, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This condition arises due to point mutations in three separate regions of the kinase domain.\nThe contact points between imatinib and the enzyme become sites of mutations in drug-resistant leukemic cells and hence these mutations prevent tight binding of the drug and lock the enzyme in its open configuration (the configuration in which it has access to the substrate and is enzymatically active).\nMechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. They include:\nAmplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases.\nOverexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown experimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.\nNilotinib retains inhibitory activity in the presence of most point mutations that confer resistance to imatinib.\n\n\n",

It is not associated with CNS stimulation.\nIt treats high blood pressure by stimulating presynaptic \uf0b0 2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding has a sympatholytic effect, by suppressing the release of norepinephrine and other sympathomimetics.\nOption A - Clonidine is an alpha 2 receptor agonist that reduces central sympathetic outflow.

They are the autoreceptors of the sympathetic system.\nClonidine is a directly acting \uf0b0 2 agonist.

This is followed by activation of central \uf0b0 2 receptors, which results in decreases the central sympathetic tone and causes a prolonged fall in blood pressure.\n2 receptors are present postsynaptically in vascular walls and activation results in the same action as \uf0b0 1 stimulation i.e., vasoconstriction.

Adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine) are used locally for vasodilation in erectile dysfunction as PIPE therapy (Phentolamine Induced Penile Erection).\nAdrenergic agonists are mainly sympathomimetic due to their action on peripheral vascular or post-synaptic alpha receptors. However, certain adrenergic agonists (like clonidine) act as a sympatholytic due to their predominant action on pre-synaptic \uf0b0 2 receptors which inhibits the release of noradrenaline.\nOptions A and B: In hypotensive states like shock and acute decompensated heart failure, short-term therapy with parenteral sympathomimetic drugs are indicated in treatment.\nOption C: Clonidine is an adrenergic agonist which acts on the pre-synaptic \uf0b0 2 receptor and is used in the treatment of hypertension.\n",

Stimulation of\n\uf0623 receptors in detrusor muscle increases the bladder capacity and provides symptomatic relief in overactive bladder.\nAntimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of oral pharmacological treatment for OAB. It acts by inhibiting muscarinic receptor subtypes, M2 and M3 in the bladder. Both subtypes are expressed in multiple tissues, resulting in anticholinergic adverse events such as dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive impairment. These adverse effects are not seen with mirabegron as it acts via adrenergic receptors.\nMirabegron is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6.

It acts as a powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor and inotrope.\nNoradrenaline causes a rise in both systolic BP and diastolic BP, resulting in a rise in the mean arterial blood pressure. This increases the organ perfusion in patients in septic shock\nor cardiogenic shock.\nAnother advantage of noradrenaline is that it does so without causing tachycardia, which is often a troublesome event with other inotropes in critical care.\nOptions A and B: The rise in mean arterial pressure causes reflex bradycardia which is not a major contributor to the treatment of septic shock.\nOption C: Low-dose dopamine infusions and furosemide are used to increase urine output in critically ill patients.\n\n\n\nEpinephrine (1:1000 solution) 0.5 ml I.M. is preferred in the treatment of anaphylactic shock.\nIn cardiac arrest, the 1:1000 adrenaline must be diluted to 1:10,000 for IV route, and used cautiously.\nAdrenaline in a concentration of 1: 50,000 to 1: 200,000 is added to local anesthetics for:\nReducing the systemic absorption\nProlonging the duration of action\nProviding a more bloodless field for surgery\n1:1000 dilution can be used for the following routes of administration:\nIntramuscular\nSubcutaneous\nInhalational (nebulization)\nIM injection is preferred over intravenous (IV) bolus because it is faster in many situations and safer (ie, lower risk of cardiovascular complications, such as severe hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias).

Therefore an increase in BP is seen with IV administration of adrenaline.\nDue to rapid metabolism and uptake, the concentration of adrenaline decreases, and the \uf0622 action predominates. Hence a decrease in BP is seen.

IV noradrenaline acts on \uf0b0 1, \uf0b0 2, and \uf0621 receptors:\n\uf0b0 1- vasoconstriction - Increases DBP.\n\uf0621 - increases heart rate and contractility - Increases SBP.\nThis increases mean arterial pressure which causes a reflex vagal activity that decreases the heart rate leading to bradycardia.\nIV adrenaline acts on \uf0b0 1, \uf0b0 2, \uf0621, \uf0622, and \uf0623 receptors:\n\uf0621 - increases SBP, tachycardia.\nDBP - either \uf0622 - decrease DBP, \uf0b0 1 - increase DBP or \uf0b0 1+\uf0622 - no change.

This is associated with a mild decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance, which is mediated by the reflex withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the vasculature.\nDobutamine has a t1/2 of 2 minutes. It resembles dopamine but no action is seen on dopamine receptors.\nRenal circulation is variably affected depending upon the sympathetic tone of the patient.\n\n\n",

Which of the following drugs can be used to perform this test?\nThalium\nNoradrenaline\nAdrenaline\nDobutamine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nDobutamine is used to perform a stress test.\nStress echocardiography is primarily done for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. The basic principle is to increase cardiac stress (either with exercise or with a drug) in a controlled fashion, to aid with the identification and localization of ischemic areas (by detecting new or worsening wall motion abnormalities).\nPerforming stress echocardiography with a pharmacologic agent such as dobutamine allows for simulation of increased heart rate and increased myocardial physiologic demands in patients who may be unable to exercise due to musculoskeletal or pulmonary comorbidities.\nDobutamine causes cardiac stress by acting on \uf0621-adrenergic receptors to increase cardiac contractility and heart rate, and on \uf0622-adrenergic receptors to cause peripheral vasodilatation. It is preferred over vasodilators used in stress echo tests such as adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson (adenosine derivative).\n\n\n",

They counter-balance each other.\nWhen muscarinic antagonists are instilled, the pupillary sphincter muscle is paralyzed, causing mydriasis due to the unopposed contraction of the dilator pupillae muscle.\nAdrenergic alpha agonists also cause mydriasis, but by mediating the contraction of the dilator pupillae muscle of iris.\nParasympatholytic drugs are classified as:\n\nClass\nDrugs\n\nMuscarinic antagonis ts\nAtropineScopolamineHomatr opineTropicamideIpratropiu m, TiotropiumDarifenacin, S olifenacinPirenzipine, Telenzi pineGlycopyrrolateUmeclidin ium\n\nNicotinic antagonists\nNnantagonists\nTrimethaphanHexamethoniu mMecamylamine\nNmantagonists\nDepolarizing\nSuxamethoniumDecamethon ium\nNon-depolarizing\nPancuroniumVecuroniumRoc uroniumd-tubocurarineMivac uriumAtracurium\n\n\n\n",

It has no cycloplegic action because sympathetic receptors are present only on the iris and not on the ciliary body.\n\nAtropine has both mydriatic and cycloplegic action, which is required for refraction testing.\nIn elderly people who have a low ciliary tone, phenylephrine is preferred as a mydriatic. This is because other anticholinergics can precipitate or aggravate glaucoma by relaxation of the ciliary body and altering the forces acting on trabecular meshwork for aqueous outflow.\nAtropine, cyclopentolate, and tropicamide are antimuscarinics that are available for ophthalmic use and cause cycloplegia to a variable extent. This cycloplegia/paralysis of accommodation occurs due to their parasympatholytic action, which decreases the tone of the ciliary body.\n\n\n",

The cycloplegia produced by tropicamide is unreliable and insignificant. It is indicated for fundoscopy and refraction testing in adults who have a relatively low ciliary tone when compared to children.\nAtropine, which produces complete cycloplegia, is preferred in children as they have a higher ciliary tone. Atropine is usually preferred over other mydriatics for accurate refractory error testing because of reliable cycloplegia.

It is a quaternary amine compound and lipid insoluble. Therefore, glycopyrrolate does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\nNon-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants are used in anesthesia. Neostigmine along with glycopyrrolate are used for reversal of this neuromuscular block. Glycopyrrolate blocks the peripheral muscarinic side effects due to the increased acetylcholine levels after the administration of neostigmine, without causing unwanted central anticholinergic effects.\nPeripheral and central anticholinergic syndromes are reactions due to either overdose or any unusual reaction to the usage of drugs like atropine and other muscarinic agents, phenothiazines, antihistamines, and tricyclic antidepressants\nOption B: Atropine is a tertiary compound that can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause central anticholinergic syndrome.\nOption C and D: Some of the first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants have significant anticholinergic activity and can cause central anticholinergic syndrome.\n\n\n",

It was popularly known as the 'lie detector'. The amnesic and depressant actions of scopolamine are due to the inhibition of the brain cholinergic system. It would put the subject off guard in case of sustained interrogation and sleep deprivation, eventually forcing the truth out.\n\nBoth ipratropium and tiotropium have a minimal inhibitory effect on mucociliary clearance when compared to atropine.

It decreases the amplitude and frequency of peristalsis, resulting in decreased bowel sounds.\nPeristalsis suppression due to atropine is incomplete because of the additional control of peristalsis by local reflexes in the enteric nervous system and involvement of other neurotransmitters like 5-HT, encephalin, dopamine in peristalsis.\nActions of atropine:\nMydriasis - by blocking the contraction of sphincter pupillae muscle\nDecreased secretions from salivary glands and lacrimal glands - by blocking M1 &amp; M3 receptors\nTachycardia - due to its vagolytic activity at M2 receptor\nDecreased sweating - by inhibiting sympathetic cholinergic supply to sweat glands which makes the skin hot and dry (atropine fever).\n\n\n",

It is seen commonly in inferior or posterior wall myocardial infarction.\nThe dosage of atropine has to be carefully adjusted when used in a patient with myocardial infarction. If the dose is too low it will aggravate the bradycardia by action on presynaptic M1 receptors.

What would be the effect on heart rate?\nTransient tachycardia followed by bradycardia\nTransient bradycardia followed by tachycardia\nMild tachycardia\nWorsening bradycardia\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nAtropine at average clinical doses of 0.4-0.6 mg administered parenterally results in transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia.\nParasympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals in the SA node contain presynaptic M1 receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the release of ACh. Therefore stimulation of these receptors decreases the release of ACh causing tachycardia. Inhibition of these receptors increases ACh causing bradycardia.\nAtropine initially blocks these presynaptic M1 receptors. This increases the amount of ACh released at the SA node and causes bradycardia. Then, the progressive increase in the atropine concentration blocks the postsynaptic M2 receptors on the SA node (decreasing the ACh release) decreasing the parasympathetic tone, thereby causing tachycardia.\n\n\n",

Drugs having significant anticholinergic action should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients prone to developing acute angle-closure glaucoma.\nThe anticholinergic action results in the relaxation of the sphincter pupillae muscle. This results in the iris coming in contact with the lens and thereby obstructing the movement of the aqueous from the posterior to the anterior chamber.\nThis results in bulging of the iris and further leads to the obliteration of the narrow iridocorneal angle.

Raw: Question 21:\n\nWhat is the most probable diagnosis in a patient with a dilated pupil not responsive to 1% pilocarpine?\nDiabetic 3rd nerve palsy\nAdie\u2019s tonic pupil\nUncal herniation\nPharmacological block\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe most appropriate answer would be a pharmacological block. Antimuscarinic will occupy the receptors and results in non-responsiveness to pilocarpine.\nIn diabetic third nerve palsy, the dilated pupil is due to the loss of innervation to constrictor pupillae. Muscarinic receptors on constrictor pupillae will be intact resulting in miosis by pilocarpine.\nIn Adie's tonic pupil, there is denervation hypersensitivity. Pupil responds to even lower concentrations of pilocarpine.\nUncal herniation causes pressure on the third nerve leading to ipsilateral mydriasis. But muscarinic receptors are intact and thus the pupil responds to pilocarpine.\n\n\n\nDexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid and is not used to decrease the intraocular pressure in glaucoma.\nAcetazolamide, apraclonidine, and mannitol are used in lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma.\n\nAnti-Anginal Drugs\n\n",
