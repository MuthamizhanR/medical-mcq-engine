It is the most common type of skin cancer most commonly seen over the face, above the line joining corner of the mouth, and lobule of the ear. Risk factors for BCC include ultraviolet radiation (strongest risk factor), age 40-80 years with excessive sun exposure, light-skinned people, and exposure to arsenic compounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and infrared light. It is more common in males than females. It is also associated with syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Gorlin's syndrome.\nFeatures of BCC include:\nPearly nodule with rolled border\nTortuous telangiectatic vessels\nSurface which can get ulcerated with raised and beaded edge, often with a central depression or umbilicatio\nBleeding on minor trauma\nBCC has various subtypes such as nodular (most common type), pigmented, nodulocystic, morphoeic, infiltrative, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus.\nIt is locally aggressive and can erode the bone or facial sinuses. It rarely metastasizes via lymph nodes.\nThe occasional presence of melanin in the nodular variant of BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to confusion with melanoma.\nDepending upon the type of the lesion, a shave, punch or excisional biopsy may be employed for diagnosis. X-ray or CT may be needed if there is a local invasion. Histology shows peripheral palisading of cells.\nTreatment:\nSurgical: Wide excision (4-6 mm clearance) with a skin graft or flap or primary suturing\nMohs' surgery for BCC close to the eyes, nose, or ear to preserve more tissue.\nNon-surgical: Radiotherapy, vismodegib and sonedegib. Other options:\nOption A: Dermatofibrosarcoma, also known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, slow-growing, well-differentiated primary fibrosarcoma of the skin, associated with increased production of platelet-derived growth factor-beta. It presents as a protuberant nodule within a firm, indurated plaque that can ulcerate. They are locally aggressive tumors with high recurrence rates. Treatment is wide excision and Mohs microscopic surgery. Imatinib is used for unresectable, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. The given image below shows a DFSP near the umbilicus.\n [Image Reference: Surgery_img_5.jpeg, Surgery_img_95.jpeg, Surgery_img_1002.jpeg]\nOption B: Marjolin's ulcer is a painless, slow-growing, locally malignant, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that occurs in a chronic scar (burns scar, scar of venous ulcer). It presents as an indurated, non-tender ulcer with raised and everted edges with scarring in the surrounding area with marked fibrosis. The ulcer can spread to the lymph nodes when it reaches the normal skin. A wedge biopsy and MRI of the region involved confirm the diagnosis.\nManagement is by wide excision, for larger ulcers, amputation is done. The given image below shows a marjolin's ulcer of the leg.\n [Image Reference: Surgery_img_5.jpeg, Surgery_img_95.jpeg, Surgery_img_1003.jpeg]\nOption D: Naevus is a common benign neoplasm caused due to mutations in the components of the RAS signaling pathway.
