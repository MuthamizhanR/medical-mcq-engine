    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nAbnormal mobility in a long bone is a pathognomonic sign of fracture.\nA fracture is a break in the structural continuity of the bone. Generally, movements occur in the limb only at the joints. If one is able to elicit mobility at locations other than the joints (say in the middle of the arm), it is a definite sign of a fracture. Crepitus may be felt while doing this. Other features of a fracture include:\nPain\nBruising\nSwelling\nDeformity\nThese can be due to a soft-tissue injury or dislocation as well.\nClinically, eliciting abnormal movement or crepitus inflicts more pain. Hence it is no longer recommended.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe correct match is:\nMost fractures occur due to a combination of forces, but the dominant mechanism of force is revealed by the type of fracture.\nType of fracture\nMechanism of fo rce\nTransverse fractur e\nTension\nOblique fracture\nCompression\nButterfly fragment\nBending\nSpiral fracture\nTwisting\n\nBased on the continuity of the periosteum, fractures can be complete or incomplete.\nIn complete fractures, the bone is split into two or more fragments and continuity of periosteum is disrupted. It can be:\nImpacted fracture - The fracture fragments are jammed together and the fracture line is not visible\nComminuted fracture - There is a fracture of more than two fragments\nSegmental fracture - A separated fragment is seen in the middle\nAvulsion fracture - Breaking of a piece of bone attached to a strong muscle. e.g. olecranon and patella fracture\nIn incomplete fractures, the bone is incompletely split and the periosteum remains in continuity. They include:\nGreenstick fractures: The outer cortex breaks and the inner cortex bends causing the bone to buckle like the snapping of a green twig. It is seen in the pediatric population.\nCompression fractures: Cancellous bone crumple due to force. This is typically seen in vertebra bodies, calcaneum, and the tibial plateau.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given clinical scenario with a history of trivial trauma, breast cancer, and the X-ray findings are suggestive of a pathological fracture due to bone metastasis. Pain in the case of a pathological fracture usually precedes the fracture.\nFractures occur due to:\nTrauma\nRepetitive stress (stress or fatigue fracture)\nAbnormal weakening of the bone (pathological fracture)\nPathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. The features suggestive of a pathological fracture include:\nPain at the site before the fracture\nMultiple recent fractures\nElderly patient\nHistory of primary malignancy\nUnusual fracture pattern (Banana fracture - transverse fracture through an abnormal area of bone, similar to breaking a segment from a banana)\n\nFDG-PET or CT is the gold standard in evaluating bony metastases. The risk of fracture in metastatic bone lesions is assessed using Mirels\u2019 score.\nA Mirels's score &gt; 8 warrants a prophylactic fixation. Management of pathological fracture is based on the causative lesion and survival of the patient.\nMirel's criteria\nScore",

    "question_text": "\n>2/3\nSolution to Question 4:\nFabry's disease does not cause pathological fractures. It presents with angiokeratomas and acroparasthesias.\nPathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma.\nIn Gaucher's disease, there is a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. This leads to an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the bone tissue, weakening the bone and causing fractures.\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs most commonly due to mutation in the COL1A and COL2A genes. This results in the abnormal formation of type 1 collagen. Since type 1 collagen is mainly present in the bone, the patient presents with repeated\nfractures with no or minimal trauma.\nHyperparathyroidism can cause severe bone resorption leading to bone pains and pathological fracture.\nOverall, osteoporosis is the most common reason for pathological fractures. Below the age of 20, the common causes of pathological fracture are benign bone tumors and cysts.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a fracture of the 2nd metatarsal are suggestive of a March fracture. It is a type of stress fracture.\nStress fractures (or fatigue fractures) occur in a normal bone that is subjected to chronic repetitive stress. This initiates a bone remodeling process. When resorption occurs faster than replacement, the bone becomes liable to fracture. Such fractures are typically seen in athletes, dancers, or military personnel who have a strenuous exercise regimen.\nCommon sites for stress fractures include:\nMetatarsals (especially the second, march fracture)\nCalcaneum\nNavicular\nDistal shaft of the fibula (runner\u2019s fracture)\nTibial shaft\nPatella\nFemoral neck\nMRI is the investigation of choice to diagnose stress fractures. It can visualize lower-grade stress injuries before X-ray changes appear. A bone scan is the investigation of choice when multiple sites have stress fractures.\nMost stress fractures are managed using an elastic bandage and avoidance of painful activity until the lesion heals. Stress fracture of the femoral neck should be managed by internal fixation as a prophylactic measure.\nThe image below shows a stress fracture:\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nIncreased callus formation is seen with flexibly fixed fractures.\nFracture heals through direct union (primary bone healing) or callus formation (secondary bone healing).\nDirect union: This occurs when the fracture site is absolutely stable. This is seen in a fracture held by a metal plate with absolute stability and in cases of impacted fracture in cancellous bones. There is no stimulus for callus formation. Osteoblastic new bone formation occurs directly between the fracture fragments.\nCallus formation: This occurs when the fracture is not fixed rigidly. The healing proceeds through 5 stages:\nHematoma formation\nInflammation\nSoft callus formation\nHard callus formation\nRemodeling\nHealing by callus ensures mechanical strength as the movement and stress make the callus grow stronger.\n\nThe image below shows callus formation:\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe technique which uses traction on the soft tissue around the bones to reduce the fracture fragments is known as ligamentotaxis. The given X-ray shows a fracture of the radial styloid process (Chauffeur's fracture or Hutchinson fracture).\nReduction of the fracture is done to ensure normal alignment and adequate apposition of the bone fragments. There are two methods of reduction:\nClosed reduction: The fracture is reduced under appropriate anesthesia and muscle\nrelaxation. Closed reduction of fracture relies on indirect fragment alignment utilizing the pull of the soft tissue envelope (ligaments and capsules), which is known as ligamentotaxis.\nOpen reduction: Operative reduction of the fracture under direct vision.\nOption A and C: Callotaxis is callus distraction or distraction osteogenesis. It is used for limb lengthening or filling of large segmental defects in the bone.\nOption D: Arthrodesis (artificial ankylosis or syndesis) is the artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones by surgery.\nSolution to Question 8:\nA hanging cast is used to treat the fractured shaft of the humerus.\nHumerus shaft fracture heals readily with just the external cast as it is usually enough to bring the fragments into alignment. The arm is placed over the lower chest with the elbow at 90\u00b0. A collar and cuff support can be used to maintain the position. The weight of the arm provides continuous traction to the humerus (traction by gravity).\n\nAfter the fracture is reduced, it is important to hold the reduction with some restriction of movements to promote soft-tissue healing and to allow free movement of the unaffected parts. The methods of holding reduction include:\nContinuous traction (traction by gravity, skin traction, or skeletal traction)\nCast splintage\nFunctional bracing\nInternal fixation\nExternal fixation\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe cast applied to a patient in the glass holding position is known as the scaphoid cast. It is used to treat scaphoid fractures.\nTo apply a scaphoid cast, the wrist is held in slight dorsiflexion and the thumb is in abduction and slight flexion as if the glass is being held between the index finger and thumb. It extends from just below the elbow to just proximal to the metacarpal necks of the digits. On the thumb, the cast extends just proximal to the interphalangeal joint.\nScaphoid fracture presents with pain and swelling over the radial aspect of the wrist. A fall on an outstretched hand could result in such a fracture. The fracture can be confirmed (when an x-ray does not show a fracture) if there is pain elicited in the anatomical snuff box on the radial border of the wrist.\nAn oblique x-ray of the wrist should be able to show a scaphoid fracture.\nSolution to Question 10:\nOpen fractures are usually associated with multiple other injuries and compartment syndrome can occur as a complication of open fractures.\nOpen fractures are characterized by a break in the overlying skin and soft tissues. Hence, the fracture fragment is exposed to the external environment. It is usually associated with multiple other injuries.\nThe most common sites involved in open fractures include\nPhalanges (Fingers and toes)\nTibial diaphysis\nDistal radius\nAnkle\nOpen fractures are more prone to develop an infection, as it's exposed to the external environment. The presence of an open fracture does not prevent the development of compartment syndrome.\nMajor components of management of all open fractures are:\nAntibiotic prophylaxis - It should be given as early as possible\nEarly debridement of the wound and fracture - This includes the following steps:\nExcision of the wound margins\nExtension of the wound if required\nDelivery of the fracture outside the wound for proper examination\nRemoval of the devitalized tissue\nCleansing of the wound to remove all the foreign materials\nNerves and tendons are usually left alone, but if the wound is clean, a repair can be considered\nWound cover:\nIn Gustilo Type I and II fractures wound cover can be done at the time of debridement (Early wound cover)\nDelayed wound cover is usually practiced in Type III fractures\nFracture stabilization - The method of stabilization depends on the degree of contamination, amount of soft tissue damage, and time from the injury to operation.\nExternal fixation is used as a temporary measure if there is a delay in wound cover\nIf definitive wound cover can be achieved at the time of debridement and there is no significant contamination, then an open fracture can be managed as same as a closed injury\nSolution to Question 11:\nThis open fracture will be classified as Type IIIB on Gustilo-Anderson's classification due to the extensive wound (&gt;10 cm), high contamination, very severe loss of soft tissue cover, and intact vascularity.\nA fracture where the skin and soft tissues are breached is known as an open fracture (or\na compound fracture). Gustilo and Anderson's classification is the most commonly followed classification for open fractures.\nOpen fractures with an arterial injury that requires repair will be classified as IIIC, irrespective of the size of the soft-tissue wound.\nSolution to Question 12:\nCapillary refill time of more than 3 seconds indicates inadequate limb perfusion. It is a surgical emergency and could be due to either vascular injury by direct trauma or compartment syndrome. Hence an orthopedic intervention will be needed urgently.\nAll other patients will also need an orthopedic intervention, however, the blood flow should be restored at the earliest.\nSolution to Question 13:\nWhen there is impaired nerve supply, primary closure of open fracture is not recommended.\nPrimary closure of open fracture is the closure of the wound by direct skin suturing during the index procedure (first debridement). In general, primary closure of wounds of Gustilo type I and II fractures can be done at the time of debridement.\nIn Gustilo type IIIA fractures, some surgeons delay closure until a second-look procedure is performed. In most cases of Gustilo type IIIB and IIIC injuries, a delayed closure is practiced.\nImportant criteria for primary closure:\nThe patient\u2019s general condition should be stable\nInjury to debridement interval is &lt; 12 hours\nAll necrotic material must have been removed\nStable fixation can be achieved either by internal or external fixation\nNormal circulation\nIntact nerve supply\nThe wound skin margins can be closed without tension\nThere should be no multisystem injuries\nSolution to Question 14:\nSurgical management is necessary for optimum functional results in Monteggia fracture (fracture of the ulnar shaft with concomitant dislocation of the radial head).\nWhile the other listed injuries may necessitate surgery in certain situations, conservative treatment for Monteggia fracture yields poor results.\nFractures in which surgical treatment will be needed to obtain an optimal result include:\nDisplaced intraarticular fractures\nUnstable fractures after failed conservative management\nMajor avulsion fractures after failed conservative management\nDisplaced pathologic fractures\nFractures in which conservative treatment is known to provide poor functional results, such as femoral neck fractures, Galeazzi fracture-dislocations, and Monteggia fracture-dislocations\nDisplaced physeal injuries with high-risk for growth arrest (Salter-Harris types III and IV)\nNonunions, especially malreduced ones, after failed conservative or operative management\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe image shows external fixation using an external fixator. Type 1 open fracture is not a common indication for external fixation.\nExternal fixation is holding the fracture using transfixing screws that pass through the bone above and below the fracture and are connected to each other by rigid bars or an external frame. This provides rigid fixation of the bones in cases where other methods of immobilization are inappropriate.\nExternal fixation is especially applicable for the tibia and pelvis. It is also used for fractures of the femur, humerus, and distal radius.\nCommon indications for external fixation:\nSevere type II and III open fractures\nFractures associated with severe burns (as burn tissue predisposes to infection and can result in osteomyelitis)\nFractures requiring grafts\nFractures requiring distraction\nLimb lengthening (Ilizarov Procedure)\nArthrodesis\nInfected fractures or nonunions\nCorrection of malunions\nThe image given below shows an external fixator applied to the right tibia:\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given clinical scenario with a history of external fixation is suggestive of a pin site infection. It appears as a ring sequestrum in an X-ray.\nSequestrum is a fragment of dead bone lying within a cavity formed by necrosis. Various types of sequestra and their causes are given in the following table:\nThe image below shows a ring sequestrum formed at the site of a pin used in the diaphysis of the tibia:\nType of Sequestrum\nCause\nTubularor diaphyseal sequest rum\nAcutepyogenicosteomyelitis\nRingsequestrum\nAmputation stump and at Ste inmannpins\nIvory sequestrum\nSyphilis\nType of Sequestrum\tCause\nType of Sequestrum\tCause\nFine sandy sequestrum\nViral osteomyelitis\nCoarse sandysequestrum\nBody of vertebra (cavity oftub erculosis)\nFlake or Feathery sequestru m\nTuberculosis of rib (cavity of tuberculosis)\nKissing sequestrum\nPeridiscal tuberculosis of vert ebra\nButton-hole sequestrum\nRadiation\nBlacksequestrum\nActinomycosis\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given image shows distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus. Osteomyelitis is not a contraindication for this procedure.\nDistraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) is the mechanical induction of new bone that occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. This is described as the tension stress effect.\nThe most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as callus distraction (or callotaxis). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator. This is used in limb lengthening or for the filling of large segmental defects in the bone.\nDistraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. This is done in four sittings\n- 0.25 mm, four times a day. It is also used in the following scenarios:\nNon-union\nDeformity correction\nOsteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone\nArthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones\nAn illustration of distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus and the radiograph depicts the procedure is given below:\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe autologous bone graft is the gold standard material for filling bone defects.\nBone grafts are used to fill the defects in bones caused due to a fracture or malignancy. Bone grafts work by various methods:\nOsteoinduction is the recruitment and differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells into bone-forming osteoprogenitor cells\nOsteoconduction is the creation of the scaffold to support the ingrowth of blood vessels, perivascular tissue, and osteoprogenitor cells\nOsteogenesis is the process of bone formation after the terminal differentiation of osteogenic progenitor cells into mature osteoblasts\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe internal fixation of a femur fracture is not an immediate concern in a patient with polytrauma and hemodynamic instability secondary to severe blood loss. Instead, splinting is preferred until the patient has been stabilized.\nDamage Control Orthopaedics (DCO) in unstable/borderline polytrauma patients involves 3 components:\nStage 1: Resuscitative procedures for rapid hemorrhage contro\nStage 2: Restoration of normal physiologic parameters\nStage 3: Definitive surgical management\nThe first stage is early temporary stabilization of unstable fractures and the control of the bleeding. In femur fracture, the most suited approach is temporary stabilization using an external fixator.\nThe second stage involves resuscitation and stabilization of the patients in the ICU.\nFinally, the third stage involves delayed definitive fracture management after the patient\u2019s condition becomes suitable. In femur fracture, the definitive procedure is intramedullary nailing which is performed after the patient becomes stable.\nComplications of fracture\nQuestion 1:\nA 7-year-old boy is brought to casualty following a fall on an outstretched hand. He has swelling and pain on his left elbow. X-ray done is given below.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray is suggestive of supracondylar fracture of the humerus in which brachial artery is most commonly injured.\nWhen there is vascular injury, the patient may complain of paraesthesia or numbness distal to the injury. On examination, the injured limb will be pale or slightly cyanosed, cold, and the pulse will be weak or absent.\nIf a vascular injury is suspected, an angiogram or duplex scan is done immediately. If the test detects vascular injury, emergency treatment must be initiated without much delay.\nSolution to Question 2:\nWrist injury is associated with damage to the median nerve, not the anterior interosseous nerve. Nerve injuries can be associated with closed fractures or open fractures:\nClosed fractures are less commonly related to nerve injury and spontaneous recovery within 4 months is observed in 90% cases. The nerve is explored if recovery is delayed beyond the expecte time, or when nerve conduction studies do not demonstrate any evidence of recovery.\nOpen fractures are more likely to cause the nerve to be completely severed. The nerve is explore and repaired at the time of debridement or during wound closure.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe most common fracture causing acute compartment syndrome in adult patients is tibial diaphyseal fractures.\nFractures are the most common cause for acute compartment syndrome. The top 3 fracture sites associated with acute compartment syndrome include:\nTibial diaphysis (shaft)\nDistal radius\nForearm bones diaphysis\nSoft tissue injury is the second most common cause of acute compartment syndrome.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe earliest symptom of acute compartment syndrome is pain.\nAcute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a fascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury.\nThe classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's:\nPain - It is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.\nParesthesia - It is the first sign of nerve ischemia.\nPallor - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.\nParalysis - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign.\nPulselessness - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.\nThe diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (\uf044P). A differential pressure (\uf044P) of less than 30 mm Hg (4.00 kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression by performing a fasciotomy.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of crush syndrome. In this condition hyperkalemia is seen, not hypokalemia.\nCrush syndrome can result when a limb is compressed for a prolonged period. For e.g. getting crushed or entrapped in a vehicle or rubble and after extended use of a pneumatic antishock garment. This results in hypoperfusion and myonecrosis in the crushed limb. When the limb is released from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury.\nCrush syndrome can result in a systemic reaction due to tissue necrosis. Free myoglobin can lead to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Myonecrosis can lead to metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The procoagulants escaped into the systemic circulation can produce systemic coagulopathy.\nManagement of crush syndrome:\nEncouraging high urine flow, along with alkalization of urine with sodium bicarbonate to prevent precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules\nRenal hemofiltration if there is oliguria or renal failure\nIf compartment syndrome is confirmed, then fasciotomy is performe\nRadical excision of necrosed muscle to avoid sepsis\nAggressive management of the open woun\nSolution to Question 6:\nReperfusion injury is not always local; it can also result in a systemic inflammatory response.\nReperfusion injury is the term used for a group of complications that follow the re-establishment of blood flow to ischemic tissues. It can also occur after fasciotomy and following restoration of blood flow to muscles in acute compartment syndrome.\nReperfusion results in an inflammatory response in the ischemic tissue, which is probably triggered by muscle breakdown products. These activate the intrinsic clotting system resulting in microvascular thrombosis. When a large amount of muscle is ischemic, there can be a\nsystemic inflammatory response and systemic coagulopathy. The mediators released into systemic circulation damage the vascular endothelium, leading to increased permeability, transcapillary fluid leakage, worsening of intra-compartmental pressure, and eventually multiple organ failure.\nSolution to Question 7:\nHistory of sudden onset breathlessness on the 3rd day of admission after femur fracture should raise suspicion of fat embolism.\nFat embolism is the presence of fat globules in vital organs and peripheral circulation after a fracture of the long bone or other major trauma. Its pathogenesis can be related to 2 factors: the release of free fatty acids by the action of lipases on the neutral fats and the actual obstruction of small pulmonary vessels by fat globules.\nClinical features:\nEarly signs are fever and tachycardia\nPresenting features are of 2 types -\nCerebral type - drowsiness, restlessness, disorientation\nPulmonary type - tachypnoea, tachycardia\nClassical triad -\nRespiratory distress\nNeurological abnormalities\nPetechial hemorrhages\nPathognomonic signs are petechiae on the trunk, axillae, conjunctival folds, and retina. Treatment of fat embolism is mainly supportive as given below:\nRespiratory support with oxygen\nHeparinization increases lipoprotein lipase activity\nIntravenous low molecular weight dextran\nCorticosteroids to avoid pneumonitis\nPrompt stabilization of long-bone fractures\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe earliest muscle to be involved in Volkmann's ischemic contracture is the flexor digitorum profundus.\nIschemic contracture of muscles affected by arterial injury or compartment syndrome is known as Volkmann\u2019s ischaemic contracture. In the forearm, it is most commonly seen following supracondylar humeral fractures.\nThe classical clinical picture of established Volkmann contracture includes:\nElbow flexion\nForearm pronation\nWrist flexion\nThumb adduction\nMetacarpophalangeal joint extension\nFinger flexion\n\nTreatment\nMild deformities - passive stretching of the contracted muscles with a turn-buckle splint\n(Volkmann\u2019s splint)\nModerate deformities - soft tissue sliding procedures (Maxpage operation)\nSevere deformities - early excision of all necrotic muscles, combined with complete median an ulnar neurolysis. This is followed by a secondary procedure of tendon transfers to restore function. If motor activity is not present in these tendons, a free innervated Gracilis muscle transfer may be considered.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis. It occurs due to immobilization and venous stasis.\nIt most commonly occurs in the calf veins and less often in the proximal veins of the thigh and pelvis. It is caused due to Virchow's triad:\nHemodynamic changes (stasis or turbulence)\nHypercoagulabilty\nEndothelial injury/dysfunction\nIt is usually asymptomatic. Some patients may present with pain in the calf or thigh. There may be an increase in temperature and pulse rate. Calf swelling and tenderness may be noted.\nIncreased pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot (Homan's test), although frequently used is now regarded as an unreliable sign.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray are suggestive of non-union. The anatomical reduction provides stability and decreases the probability of non-union.\nNonunion is when a fracture has failed to heal within the expected time and is unlikely to heal without a new intervention. The US Federal Drug Administration (USFDA) defines non-union\nas failure to achieve union by 9 months since the injury, and for which there have been no signs of healing for 3 months. Improper immobilization is the most common cause of non-union.\nDelayed union is when a fracture has failed to heal within the expected time but has the potential to heal without further intervention.\nRisk factors for non-union include the following:\nHost related factors -\nAdvanced age\nMalnutrition\nSmoking\nEndocrine diseases (diabetes)\nImmunosuppression\nOsteoporosis\nVascular diseases\nTaking medications that delay bone healing\nFracture related factors -\nHigh energy fractures\nGreater degree of soft tissue injury\nBone loss\nPeriosteal stripping\nDevascularization\nInfection/contamination\nTreatment related factors -\nLack of good stabilization\nFollowing improper technique such as poor casting\nRigid fixation with bone gaps\nNSAIDs (implicated in some studies)\nSolution to Question 11:\nAmong the given fractures, proximal scaphoid fractures are most prone to non-union.\nSince the nutrient artery enters the scaphoid near its distal end, proximal fractures are associated with avascular necrosis and non-union. The more proximal the fracture in the scaphoid, the higher the chances of avascular necrosis and non-union.\nCertain bones have a relatively limited or watershed blood supply that can potentially get interrupted by fracture. These include:\nHead of the femur: after fracture of the neck or posterior dislocation of the hip.\nProximal scaphoid: due to fracture through the waist of the scaphoid.\nLunate: following a dislocation.\nBody of talus: after fracture of its neck.\nFractures in these sites have a higher risk for non-union or development of osteonecrosis. Other options:\nOption B: Inter-trochanteric fractures involve either the greater or lesser trochanters or both, more common in the elderly following a history of a fall. Malunion is the most frequent complication. The vast metaphyseal region has an abundant blood supply, contributing to a higher union rate and fewer chances of avascular necrosis.\nOption C: Distal radius fractures occur by fall on an outstretched hand and they include Colles' fracture (most common), Smith's fracture, Barton's fracture, and Chauffer's fracture. The complications include joint stiffness, malunion (more common), carpal tunnel syndrome, subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, Sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon. Avascular necrosis or non-union is rare.\nOption D: Olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow. Complications include non-union, elbow stiffness, and osteoarthritis.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given X-ray shows hypertrophic non-union of the tibia.\nAlthough the enlarged fracture ends suggest active osteogenesis, the gap is not bridged because of inadequate stability. Such non-unions have adequate vascularity and display abundant callus.\nBased on the biologic potential for fracture healing, non-union can be of the following types:\nAtrophic: Poor healing response with no callus formation due to little or no active bone-forming cells at the fracture site. The blood supply is typically poor. On radiography, there is an absence of bone reaction.\nOligotrophic: There is minimal callus formation, often due to inadequate approximation of fracture surfaces. On radiography, there is minimal bone healing reaction.\nHypertrophic: These fractures have an adequate healing response and good vascularity. There is a lack of adequate stability for the union to occur. On radiography, there is usually abundant callus formation with an intervening dark area of fibrocartilage-lacking mineral. It can occur after initial nonoperative management or in some cases after initial operative management where there was inadequate stabilization.\nPseudoarthrosis has features of hypertrophic nonunion, but due to excessive and chronic motility, there is the formation of a pseudo-capsule containing fluid similar to an actual synovial joint.\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nStabilization using casts and braces are used in the treatment of hypertrophic nonunion. Management of nonunion:\nHypertrophic nonunion: Stabilization to allow chondrocyte-mediated mineralization of the fibrocartilage between fracture ends. With stabilization, healing usually occurs by 8 weeks.\nOligotrophic nonunion: Correcting the issues related to bone contact through mechanical compression or bone grafting to close the defects. In some cases, a combination of biologic an mechanical methods is used.\nAtrophic nonunion: Autogenous bone graft or BMP to provide biologic stimulus at the fracture site. The other procedure done is debridement or excision of the non-vital bone ends.\nPseudoarthrosis: Debridement of the pseudoarthrosis, opening of the medullary canal an providing more stability usually with compression at the nonunion site. In some cases, biologic stimulation may be helpful to promote healing.\nSolution to Question 14:\nAtrophic nonunions require bone grafting and stabilization in order to heal.\nAutogenous bone graft remains the standard graft substance used in the repair of atrophic nonunions. Bone grafts are also used in some cases of oligotrophic nonunions and pseudoarthroses. The anterior iliac crest is the most common site from which grafts are obtained followed by the fibula.\nThe below X-ray image shows atrophic nonunion of humeral shaft 18 months after ORIF.\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nInternal fixation is not a common strategy used in the treatment of infected non-unions.\nThis is because metal implants promote adherence of microbes and cause biofilm formation. They also adversely affect phagocytosis and control of infection. The diagnostic gold standard for detecting infection in fracture nonunion sites is deep tissue or bone culture.\nStrategies used in the management of infected non-unions include:\nRemoval of internal implants if the infection is problematic or when bone grafting is required. Implants are retained if the infection can be controlled and union can be achieved without grafting procedures.\nManagement of the infectious process by debridement of the infected nonviable bone an surrounding nonviable soft tissues, parenteral antibiotics, and bone stabilization.\nLocal antibiotic delivery may be performed, especially when there is dead space due to debridement. Antibiotic-impregnated synthetic materials are used, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement beads.\nCancellous autograft with antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamycin).\nStabilization with an Ilizarov fixator.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given clinical scenario and x-ray showing flattening of the femoral head is suggestive of avascular necrosis. It is most commonly seen after a fracture neck of femur.\nThe patient complains of pain and walks with a limp. The condition is treated by a total hip replacement. If untreated, osteoarthritis of the hip develops.\nThe image below shows the crescent sign, which is caused by the necrotic and repair processes that occur during avascular necrosis.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray is suggestive of myositis ossificans which is a complication of fracture. Recurrence of this condition can be prevented by indomethacin and radiotherapy.\nMyositis ossificans is defined as ectopic benign pathological bone formation. It is most commonly seen after dislocation of elbow or a blow to brachialis, deltoid or quadriceps. The patient presents with gross restriction of range of movements and should be advised not to massage the site as it promotes ossification.\nTreatment involves joint rest in the position of function until the pain subsides, followed by gentle movements. After a few months if the pain and restriction still persist then the bony mass is excised.\nThe X-ray given below shows myositis ossificans.\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nAmong the given options, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) is the substance used for bone formation in a patient with non-union.\nBMP is a bone-stimulating protein used as a bone graft in the treatment of non-union and open tibial fractures.\nBone grafts can be:\nOsteoinductive: They stimulate osteogenesis through the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoprogenitor cells. BMPs are osteoinductive.\nOsteoconductive: They provide linkage across defects and a scaffold upon which new bone can form. Calcium phosphate (Option C), calcium hydroxyapatite, and calcium sulfate (Option D) are osteoconductive.\nPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), also known as bone cement, holds bone and metal implants together by forming an interlocking network between the irregularities.\nRegional conditions of neck\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the most common cause for congenital torticollis?\nCMV infection\nNeurogenic\nFibrosis\nTumors\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following features would you least expect to see in a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome?\nShort neck\nLow posterior hairline\nLimited neck movements\nElevated scapula\nQuestion 3:\nWhat is the most common skeletal anomaly associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome?\nHigh scapula\nVertebra plana\nScoliosis\nPseudoarthosis\nQuestion 4:\nA 6-year-old boy presented with the following findings.

However, it is associated with Sprengel deformity, which occurs in approximately 30% of cases.\nThe classic clinical triad seen in this condition includes:\nShort neck\nLow posterior hairline\nLimited range of neck motion\nKlippel-Feil syndrome is a developmental disorder caused by a failure of normal segmentation of the cervical somites during the 3rd to 8th week of embryogenesis. This results in a congenital fusion of at least 2 cervical vertebrae, sometimes a block of cervical vertebrae, and rarely the entire cervical spine.\n\nrays may show the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. The vertebrae are also widened and flattened (wasp-waist appearance).\nThe below radiograph from a Klippel-Feil syndrome patient shows the fusion of C6, C7, and T1 vertebrae:\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nMost common skeletal anomaly associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome is scoliosis. Klippel-Feil syndrome is often associated with other skeletal and extraskeletal anomalies:\nSkeletal anomalies: scoliosis &gt; Sprengel deformity &gt; cervical ribs\nExtraskeletal anomalies: renal abnormalities &gt; deafness &gt; congenital heart disease\nVentricular septal defect is the most common cardiovascular anomaly associated with this syndrome.\nSynkinesis (mirror movements) is involuntary paired movements of hands and arms seen in around 20% of children with Klippel-Feil syndrome. The child cannot move one hand without a similar reciprocal movement in the opposite hand.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe image shows an upward elevation of the scapula relative to the thoracic cage characteristically seen in Sprengel deformity.\nSprengel deformity is a congenital upward elevation of the scapula. It is due to the failure of the scapula to descend completely in embryonic life.\nThe affected scapula is smaller, shaped differently, abnormally high, and somewhat prominent. Shoulder movements are usually painless. Abduction and elevation of shoulders may be limited due to fixation of the scapula.\nThe Cavendish classification is used to grade the severity of Sprengel deformity.\nIf the deformity is mild, no treatment is required. In severe deformity, surgery may be indicated. These procedures include:\nGreen procedure\nWoodward procedure\nMears procedure\nSolution to Question 5:\nDextrocardia is not associated with Sprengel deformity.\nSprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. It is characterized by an elevated shoulder on the affected side, with an abnormally high, smaller, and prominent scapula. The neck appears shorter, and there may be kyphosis or scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine. While shoulder movements are painless, abduction and elevation may be limited due to scapular fixation.\nAbnormalities associated with Sprengel deformity include:\nKlippel-Feil Syndrome\nKyphosis or Scoliosis\nCervical rib\nOmovertebral bar (a bony bridge between the scapula and the cervical spine)\nSpina bifida\nDiastematomyelia (congenitally split spinal cord)\nTorticollis\nRenal abnormalities\nThe image below shows Sprengel deformity:\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nBasilar impression (basilar invagination) is a deformity in which there is an indention of the skull floor by the upper cervical spine.\nBasilar invagination is invagination (infolding) of the base of the skull that occurs when the top of the C2 vertebra migrates upward. It can cause narrowing of the foramen magnum (the opening in the skull where the spinal cord passes through to the brain). It also may press on the lower brainstem.\nBasilar impression can be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired).\nPrimary: Congenital defect in bone development at the craniocervical junction. The tip of the dontoid bone is more cranial than normal.\nSecondary: Acquired deformity due to systemic diseases that affect bony structures at the base of the skull.\nNeurologic symptoms are seen due to pressure on the brainstem such as weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. There can be symptoms related to compression of cranial nerves (trigeminal, vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal) and the vertebral artery.\nCraniometric parameters used for diagnosis include McRae\u2019s line, Chamberlain\u2019s line, and McGregor\u2019s line.\nTreatment is by surgical decompression and stabilization with a posterior occipito-cervical arthrodesis. Odontoidectomy is done if compression is due to aberrant odontoid.\nThe below image shows basilar invagination in an infant with indentation of the medulla oblongata by the odontoid process.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nCleidocranial dysostosis does not cause thoracic outlet syndrome.\nTumor arising from the upper lobe of the lung (eg: Pancoast tumor), cervicothoracic scoliosis, and malunion or nonunion of fracture clavicle are causes of thoracic outlet syndrome.\nSolution to Question 8:\nPatients with thoracic outlet syndrome typically complain of pain and paresthesias along the medial aspect of the arm, forearm and medial two fingers.\nThis corresponds to the most common roots compressed in a thoracic outlet syndrome which are C8 and T1.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nJobe's test is not a provocative test for thoracic outlet syndrome. Jobe's test is performed to evaluate for shoulder impingement syndrome.\nThe provocative tests for thoracic outlet syndrome include Adson's test, Wright's test, and Roos's test.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe test performed in the image is Roos test. It is also referred to as the elevated arm stress test\n(EAST). It is a provocative test for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.\nFor this test, the patient abducts the shoulders to 90 degrees and flexes the elbow to 90 degrees. The patient is made to open and close the hand repeatedly for three minutes. The test is positive if the patient is unable to complete the test or experiences cramping, pain, numbness, on the affected side.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe test performed in the given video is Allen's test.\nAllen's test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation.\nProcedure:\nThe radial and ulnar arteries are occluded as the patient makes a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm.\nThen the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released.\n\nInterpretation:\nAs occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of the open palm is observed. Normally, the color will return to the palm within 5 \u2013 6 seconds.\nIf the palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow.\nThe modified Allen\u2019s test considers a threshold of 5 to 15 seconds. Clinical significance:\nIn recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients at increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of this test is poor.\nIt is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use for coronary angiography.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given X-ray shows a cervical rib on the left side.\n\nThe cervical rib is an additional rib that arises from the 7th cervical vertebra. It may be a complete rib or incomplete and present for a short distance with the anterior part having a fibrous band. It is usually unilateral and more common on the right side.\nIn most individuals with cervical rib, there are no symptoms. It is incidentally detected on radiographs. In a small proportion of individuals with cervical rib, it can cause symptoms of thoracic outlet obstruction due to pressure on the neurovascular structures. These symptoms manifest after the age of 30 years as the shoulders start to sag with increasing age.\nThe absence of a rib on the x-ray does not rule out the possibility of a cervical rib. CT and MRI are more sensitive.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe clinical features and the X-ray image showing degenerative changes and bony spurring at C5-6, the most possible diagnosis is cervical spondylosis. Among the operations listed, posterior decompression is not a treatment option for cervical spondylosis.\nCervical spondylosis is a disorder arising due to chronic intervertebral disc degeneration in the cervical region. Changes are most common in lower cervical segments such as C5/6 and C6/7. The most common clinical feature is pain and stiffness of the neck. The X-ray may show osteophytes and degenerative changes.\nTreatment:\nConservative treatment with analgesics, physiotherapy and the cervical collar is the mainstay\nOperative treatments performed include:\nAnterior discectomy and fusion\nForaminotomy\nIntervertebral disc replacement\nLaminoplasty\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe CT scan shows an ossified posterior longitudinal ligament, which is usually seen after the age of 50 years.\nIt is associated with various bone-forming conditions such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) and fluorosis. It is most commonly seen in the cervical spine. It can result in spinal stenosis and cervical myelopathy causing pain and weakness in the limbs. X-ray shows dense ossification along the back of the vertebral bodies in the mid-cervical spine.\nTreatment is needed if the symptoms are progressive. Posterior decompression is the operation of choice.\n\nInjuries of clavicle, shoulder and arm\nQuestion 1:\nWhich part of the clavicle is most commonly fractured?\nMedial third\nMiddle third\nLateral third\nMedial half\nQuestion 2:\nA biker fell on his shoulder due to an accident.

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe middle third of the clavicle is most commonly fractured.\nThe middle third of the clavicle is narrowest and has the least amount of surrounding soft tissue structures. Therefore, 80% of fractures are seen in this area.\nWithin the middle-third of the clavicle, the junction of the medial 3/5th and the lateral 2/5th has been described to be the weakest point. Lateral third fractures are the second most common type of clavicular fractures.\nFall on the shoulder (direct impact) and fall on the outstretched hand are the most common causes of clavicle fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe lateral fragment in a clavicle fracture is displaced inferiorly due to the force of gravity acting on the ipsilateral arm.\nThe medial fragment is held up by the action of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n(N te: Both Pectoralis muscle and the weight of arm are responsible, but since the weight of arm is superior to the muscle bulk and even as per standard reference we would go with the rational explanation.)\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nN n-union is a relatively rare complication in clavicle shaft fracture. Malunion is the most common complication in clavicle fractures\nThe most common bone to be fractured is the clavicle. It is also the most common bone to be fractured during birth. Neurological deficit is rare in clavicular shaft fractures.\nUndisplaced fractures are treated with a sling or figure of eight bandages for 2-3 weeks. This is followed by mobilization of the limb as the pain subsides.\nDisplaced fractures are treated with internal fixation either by contoured locking plates or intramedullary nails.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nVelpeau bandage is not used in glenoid fossa fractures as they require surgical fixation because they are intra-articular.\nVelpeau bandaging is done by keeping the patient's elbow flexed and the forearm placed against the chest. A sling is then applied to support the weight of the arm. Several layers of restrictive bandages are then applied around the arm and the torso.\nVelpeau bandage is commonly used for:\nAcromioclavicular dislocations\nHumeral shaft fractures\nAfter open reduction of posterior shoulder dislocation\nAcromioclavicular joint injuries are usually seen with direct injury to the lateral shoulder. They are also seen after fall on an outstretched arm with the elbow locked in extension.\nThey are classified into six types using the Rockwood classification. Type 1-3 is managed conservatively using the Velpeau bandage. Type 4-6 is treated by open reduction and internal fixation.\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe inferior glenohumeral ligament is the most important in maintaining shoulder joint stability. It is the main stabilizer when the shoulder is abducted and in extreme ranges of motion.\nThe shoulder joint is anatomically unstable. Only 25% of the humeral head articulates with the glenoid.\nThe joint is reinforced by:\nStatic stabilizers (3 capsular thickenings or ligaments):\nSuperior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL)\nMiddle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL)\nInferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)\nDynamic stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles):\nSupraspinatus\nInfraspinatus\nTeres minor\nSubscapularis\nThe long head of biceps\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThis radiograph shows anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The nerve commonly injured in anterior dislocation is the axillary nerve, not the radial nerve.\nThe radiograph shows the disturbed articulation between the humeral head and glenoid fossa. The humeral head is seen below and medial to the glenoid socket. This suggests anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint.\nCommon cause for anterior dislocation:\nYoung adults - athletic injuries\nElderly - falls\nBankart lesion is a tear in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum caused by the head of the humerus during anterior dislocation.\nHill-Sachs lesion is a compression fracture on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. It is caused by the pressure of the anterior glenoid rim on the humeral head in recurrent dislocations.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe bony bankart lesion is a small, avulsion fracture of the glenoid rim.\nDuring an anterior shoulder dislocation, the head of the humerus can tear the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum. This is known as Bankart lesion. In some cases, a small fragment of bone from the glenoid rim can also get avulsed. This is known as a bony Bankart lesion.\nAvulsion of posterior capsular periosteum is seen in reverse Bankart lesion.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above clinical scenario is suggestive of anterior shoulder dislocation. It cannot be diagnosed with the help of Gerber's test. This test is used to diagnose impingement between the rotator cuff and the coracoid process.\nFour tests can be used to diagnose anterior dislocation of the shoulder:\nBryant's test\nDugas test\nHamilton ruler test\nCallaway test\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe correct order of steps in Kocher's manoeuvre is traction \uf0b0  external\nrotation \uf0b0 adduction \uf0b0 medial rotation (TEAM). This is used for the reduction of anterior shoulder dislocation.\nOther maneuvers used in anterior dislocation of the shoulder include:\nStimson\u2019s gravity method\nHippocratic method (traction counter-traction)\nSolution to Question 10:\nPutti-Platt\u2019s operation for shoulder instability involves overlapping and tightening of the subscapularis tendon and capsule. It is not commonly done anymore.\nSurgeries done for shoulder instability include:\nBankart\u2019s operation (most common): The glenoid labrum and the capsule are re-attached to the front of the glenoid rim.\nLaterjet-Bristow\u2019s operation: The coracoid process is osteotomized and transplanted along with its muscle attachments to the anterior rim of the glenoid.\nNeer\u2019s capsular shift: The shoulder joint capsule is detached from the neck of the humerus and shifted inferior to the neck.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe history and clinical features are suggestive of posterior dislocation of shoulder.\nPosterior dislocation of the shoulder usually occurs with an indirect force causing marked internal rotation and adduction. This condition can be seen after a convulsion, or an electric shock. It can also occur after a fall on the flexed and adducted arm, or after a direct blow to the front of the shoulder.\nThe classical attitude of the arm is internal rotation and locked in that position. The examiner will be unable to externally rotate the arm back to normal position.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe light bulb sign can be seen on the given AP radiograph of the left shoulder. It is seen in cases of posterior dislocation of the shoulder.\nIn posterior dislocation of the shoulder, the humerus rotates internally. This causes changes to the normal radiographic contour of the head of the humerus. The humerus appears similar to a lightbulb in AP views.\n\nOther radiological signs described in posterior dislocation of the shoulder in the AP view are as follows:\nThe rim sign: Widening of the glenohumeral joint space &gt; 6 mm\nThe vacant glenoid sign: The glenoid fossa looks empty as the humeral head has moved away from it\nThe trough sign: A vertical line is seen on the anteromedial part of humeral head due to the impression fracture by the glenoid labrum\nOption A: Comolli's sign is seen in scapular fracture. Option C: Destot's sign is seen in pelvic fracture.\nOption D: Oliver's sign is seen in aortic aneurysm.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe reverse Hill-Sachs lesion is seen on the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head.\nIt is also known as McLaughlin lesion. it refers to an impaction fracture of the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head.\nIt is seen following a posterior dislocation of the humerus. This occurs due to the impact of the glenoid rim on the humeral head.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn the above clinical scenario, the history and radiograph suggest an inferior dislocation of the shoulder, which is also known as luxatio erecta.\nInferior dislocation is rare and occurs when the arm is forcefully pulled up when in full abduction (hyper-abduction force). The head of the humerus gets forced out of the inferior part of the capsule and comes to lie below the glenoid.\nThe patient will present with the arm locked in abduction. On examination, the humeral head may be felt in or below the axilla.\nThe X-ray below shows disturbed articulation between the humeral head and glenoid. The humeral head is seen below the glenoid. The humerus shaft is in the abducted position. This is characteristic of luxatio erecta.\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe most common sequela of traumatic shoulder dislocation in young adults is recurrent dislocations of the shoulder joint.\nTraumatic shoulder dislocation is associated with tear of the glenoid labrum (Bankart lesion). This results in loss of attachment of the inferior glenohumeral ligament, which is the primary static stabilizer of the shoulder.\nIn addition, there is a loss of concavity due to damage to the labrum. Therefore, the shoulder joint becomes unstable. This predisposes the person to repeated shoulder dislocations. Shoulder instability/recurrent dislocation is an indication for surgical intervention.\nSolution to Question 16:\nIn the above clinical scenario, the history and examination findings suggest a fracture of the proximal humerus. It is most commonly seen in osteoporotic, postmenopausal women.\nThe most common mechanism of injury in fracture of the proximal humerus is falling on the outstretched hand. The patient usually presents with localized shoulder pain and limitation of movement in the affected arm.\nClinical features:\nSoft tissue swelling and ecchymosis\nBony tenderness over the upper part of the humerus\nNormal contour of the shoulder is retained ( maybe lost in severe fractures and fracture-dislocations)\nAxillary nerve is the most common nerve to be injured in proximal humerus fractures Management:\nUndisplaced proximal humerus fractures are treated using an arm pouch or sling.\nDisplaced and unstable fractures are treated by open reduction and internal fixation.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe most commonly used classification system for proximal humeral fractures is Neer's classification.\nNeer classification is based on the displacement of 4 major anatomical components of the proximal humerus:\nHumeral head\nLesser tuberosity\nGreater tuberosity\nProximal humeral shaft\nDisplacement is defined as the separation of any part by more than 1 cm or angulation of more than 45 degrees.\nBased on the number of parts displaced, these fractures are classified into 4 major groups. It is divided into one-part fracture, two-part fractures, three-part fractures, and four-part fractures.\nSolution to Question 18:\nIn the above clinical scenario, the history and radiograph suggest a closed fracture of the shaft of the humerus.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe three-point bony relationship of the elbow is maintained in case of supracondylar fracture of the humerus. This is because the fracture occurs above the level of these bony landmarks.\nSolution to Question 2:\nPosterior displacement or extension type is more common in supracondylar fracture of the humerus.\nIt is the most common fracture following a fall on an outstretched hand. Most commonly seen in children between 5-8 years of age. On examination, an S-shaped deformity may be seen at the elbow. If the proximal fracture fragment is sharp and has penetrated the muscles and fascia, a dimple may be seen on the skin above the elbow (dimple sign).\nFractures are broadly classified into either extension or flexion types. Extension type fractures are further classified using Gartland's classification as:\nType I - Undisplaced fractures\nType II - Displaced fractures but with intact posterior cortex\nType III - Displaced fractures, with no intact posterior cortex, and the fragment may be displaced either posteromedially or posterolaterally\nCharacteristic displacements (MID) include medial rotation/ medial tilt, impaction/ proximal shift, dorsal displacement/ dorsal tilt.\n\nOn radiology:\nSail sign/ fat pad sign - an undisplaced fracture may show a triangular lucency like a sail of a yacht. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed forward by hematoma\nFish-tail sign - due to rotation of the distal fragment, the anterior border of the proximal fragment looks like a sharp spike\nBaumann\u2019s angle / humeral-capitellar angle - can help in assessing the degree of medial angulation before reduction\n\nTreatment includes:\nUndisplaced fractures - immobilization at 90 degrees flexion in a cast for 3 weeks\nComminuted or compound fractures - Dunlop's (skin) or Smith's (skeletal) traction\nDisplaced fractures - closed reduction with percutaneous fixation\nIn open or severely displaced fractures or fractures with vascular damage, open reduction with K-wire fixation is indicated.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given x-ray shows a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Malunion leading to cubitus varus (gunstock deformity) is the most common complication following this fracture. Cubitus valgus is a very rare complication.\nCubitus varus is characterized by posterior displacement, horizontal rotation, and coronal tilt of the distal fragment. Correction methods include:\nLateral closed-wedge osteotomy\nMedial open-wedge osteotomy (King's osteotomy) The images below shows gunstock deformity.\n\n\nComplications of supracondylar fracture of the humerus can occur early or late. Early complications :\nVascular injury - to the brachial artery resulting in\nVolkmann's ischemia\nCompartment syndrome\nVolkmann\u2019s ischemic contracture\nNerve injury - to the anterior interosseus nerve&gt; median &gt;radial &gt;ulnar nerve Late complications :\nGunstock deformity\nElbow stiffness\nHeterotopic ossification (myositis ossificans)\nPatients with anterior interosseous nerve injury are unable to perform the OK sign. This is due to weak flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles. The fingers get pinched, and instead of the tips, the volar surfaces of the thumb and index finger make contact.\nSolution to Question 4:\nFracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus is most likely to be seen in a child with a fall on an outstretched hand in a varus position.\nA large fragment of bone including the lateral condyle breaks off and is pulled away by\nthe attached wrist extensors. The normal 3-point bony relationship at the elbow is lost. It is a Salter-Harris type IV injury as it crosses the growth plate and the epiphysis. It is an\nintra-articular fracture.\nThese fractures are managed surgically (fracture of necessity) with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using either screws or K-wire.\nNon-union is commonly seen in these fractures. If left untreated, the lateral growth plate fails to grow, while the medial one continues to grow, resulting in a cubitus valgus deformity.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given image shows cubitus valgus deformity on the left side. It can lead to late-onset ulnar palsy (tardy ulnar nerve palsy) leading to anaesthesia at the tip of the little finger.\nCubitus valgus deformity is a late complication of non-union of fracture of lateral condyle of the humerus.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given scenario of spinning the child by holding his hands, followed by features suggesting pain and inability to use the arm, points to a diagnosis of pulled elbow.\nPulled elbow or nursemaid's elbow refers to the dislocation of the radial head over the annular ligament, commonly seen in children under the age of 6 years. The mechanism of injury is through axial traction on the extended and pronated forearm. This happens when a child is pulled, lifted, or swung by the arm.\nFollowing the dislocation, the child holds the arm relatively immobile, with the elbow extended and the forearm pronated, and resists supination.\nThe diagnosis is primarily clinical, though X-rays are usually obtained to exclude a fracture.\nTo treat the condition, simple analgesia is administered, and while the child's attention is diverted, the elbow is extended and pronated to relocate the radial head with a snap. This technique is preferred over the alternative method of supination and flexion, which tends to be more painful and less successful.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn the case of the pulled elbow, the elbow lies in extension and the forearm is pronated.\nCharacteristically, the child holds the elbow in extension with the forearm pronated (Option A) and resists supination.\nThe treatment is done under simple analgesia (Option B) and the procedure is attempted while diverting the child's attention.\nThere are two methods to treat this condition:\nExtension and pronation: In this technique, the elbow is extended and pronated (Option D) to relocate the radial head with a snap. This technique is reported to be more successful and less painful and, hence, is the preferred treatment.\nSupination and flexion: The elbow is supinated and flexed to relocate the radial head within the annular ligament.\nSolution to Question 8:\nPosterior dislocations are the commonest type of elbow dislocation.\nElbow joint is the most common joint to dislocate in children. They usually result from a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow in extension. It may be associated with soft tissue injury involving the brachial artery, ulnar, median, and radial nerve.\nThese dislocations occur with a progression from lateral to the medial side, termed as Hori\u2019s circle. Complete dislocation is usually associated with disruption of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments and anterior capsule.\nPatients present with severe pain at the elbow, and with the elbow in flexion. The three bony points relationship is disturbed. The triceps tendon becomes prominent (bowstringing of triceps).\nReduction is done under anesthesia followed by immobilization in an above-elbow plaster slab for 3 weeks.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe terrible triad of the elbow does not include fracture of olecranon. The terrible triad of the elbow or Hotchkiss triad includes:\nPosterior dislocation of the elbow\nRadial head fracture\nFracture coronoid process of the ulna\nNote: Unhappy triad of the knee occurs due to a lateral blow to the knee causing injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, medial meniscus, and medial collateral ligament.\nSolution to Question 10:\nray showing an extra-articular fracture at the distal end of the radius with dorsal angulation of the distal fragment is characteristic of Colles' fracture.\nDisplacements in Colles' fracture:\nDorsal tilt/ shift\nLateral tilt/ shift (Radial tilt/shift)\nSupination\nImpaction of fragments\n\nThe clinical feature includes dinner fork deformity with prominence on the back of the wrist and depression in the front. It is treated by a Colles\u2019 cast, which immobilizes the wrist in palmar flexion, pronation, and ulnar deviation.\nThe below image shows dinner fork deformity in Colles' fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nRupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL) occasionally occurs as a late complication of Colles\u2019 fracture.\nThis probably results from damage to the tendon by the sharp edges of the fracture fragments. It is followed by aseptic necrosis of a section of the tendon due to compression in the callus leading to attrition rupture.\nComplications of Colles' fracture :\nJoint stiffness - Finger stiffness is the most common complication. Wrist, elbow, and shoulder are the other joints that can become stiff\nMalunion - is the second most common complication, and leads to dinner fork deformity\nSudeck\u2019s osteodystrophy/ reflex sympathetic dystrophy\nRupture of extensor pollicis longus tendon\nCarpal tunnel syndrome - causing median nerve compression\nNon-union - extremely rare\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe correct order of reduction Colles' fracture is traction, palmar flexion, ulnar deviation, POP. Management of Colles' fracture:\nUndisplaced fractures - Immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast for 6 weeks\nDisplaced fractures - Closed manipulative reduction and immobilization in Colles' cast\nComminuted fractures in young adults - Surgical correction with percutaneous K-wire fixation, external fixators, or locking compression plates\nThe technique of reduction of Colles' fracture is as follows:\nDisimpaction of the fracture fragments by longitudinal traction against counter traction rovided by the assistant\nThe distal fragment is then pressed into palmar flexion followed by ulnar deviation\nThe patient's hand is drawn into pronation, palmar flexion, and ulnar deviation\nA Colles' cast is then applied, extending from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads, with the wrist in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nGarden spade deformity is seen in Smith's fracture.\nSmith\u2019s fracture is the fracture of the distal one-third of the radius with palmar displacement. It is also called reverse Colles' fracture because it has displacements opposite to that of Colles' fracture i.e, pronation, palmar angulation, and ulnar deviation.\nThe images given below shows Smith's fracture with garden-spade deformity.\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe provided history of falling on an outstretched arm and the X-ray revealing an oblique fracture in the lower third of the radius with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint point to the diagnosis of Galeazzi's fracture.\nGaleazzi's fracture is the fracture of the lower third of the radius and the subluxation or dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. This injury usually happens when one falls on an outstretched hand.\nPatients present with pain, swelling, and deformity at the lower end of the radius. On examination, the disruption of the radio-ulnar joint can be elicited by pressing the lower end of the ulna. The ulna moves down and comes back like the key of a piano (piano-key sign).\nThe aim of treatment for this fracture is to preserve supination and pronation of the forearm. In children, closed reduction is usually enough to achieve perfect reduction. However, in adults, open reduction using a k-wire fixation or compression plating is usually required. It is also important to look for ulnar nerve damage.\nGaleazzi's fracture can cause complications such as malunion due to displacement of the fragment. This often results in deformity and limitation in supination and pronation.\nSolution to Question 15:\nGaleazzi fracture-dislocation in an adult is managed by internal fixation with compression plating of the radius. In children, closed reduction is usually successful.\nNote: Galeazzi's sign is seen in developmental dysplasia of the hip where the infant's knees are flexed and approximated when lying down. One knee is higher than the other in developmental dysplasia.\nThe below image shows Galeazzi's sign.\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given X-ray shows a fracture in the proximal third of the ulna and there is a dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint, which points to a diagnosis of Monteggia fracture-dislocation.\nDislocation of the head of the radius can be detected using McLaughlin\u2019s line (radiocapitellar line). A line drawn along the center of the shaft of the radius will cut the capitellum of the humerus in the center irrespective of the position of the elbow. In Monteggia fracture this relationship is disturbed.\nThe mechanism of injury in these fractures is usually a fall on the outstretched hand. Clinical features include:\nDeformity in the proximal forearm - due to ulnar fracture. The dislocation of the head of the radius may be masked by the swelling\nPain and tenderness on the lateral side of the elbow - due to proximal radioulnar dislocation\nMonteggia fracture is treated surgically (fracture of necessity). The ulnar fracture is reduced and bone restored to full length. It is then fixed with a plate and screws. The radial head usually reduces once the ulna is fixed.\nThe below image shows radiocapitellar line (McLaughlin\u2019s line) in a normal x-ray.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe radiograph reveals a distal radial fracture that extends into the intra-articular region. This is known as Barton's fracture. In this case, the dorsal segment is fractured, and therefore, this is a dorsal Barton's fracture.\nConservative treatment involves applying a short arm cast with the wrist in the neutral position. Surgical management is by open reduction and internal fixation with percutaneous pins or small plates and screws.\nReverse (volar) Barton's fracture is an articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation in which the articular surface of the radius remains in contact with the carpus; however, the reverse type involves the volar portion rather than the dorsal aspect of the radius.\nConservative management is with a long-arm cast. Surgical fixation with K- wires, external fixators, and buttress plates are considered if the reduction is not properly retained.\nEllis-T-shaped buttress plate fixation is preferred.\nThe below images shows reverse (volar) Barton's fracture.\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given X-ray shows a displaced transverse fracture of the olecranon. Tension band wiring is one of the management methods in this case.\nThe Mayo classification divides olecranon fractures into three groups based on fracture displacement and elbow stability. Each group is further subdivided into comminuted or noncomminuted fractures.\nType I - Undisplaced fractures\nType II - Displaced but stable fractures\nType III - Unstable fractures Treatment includes:\nType I fractures - non-operative management\nType II and III fractures - surgery\nSimple fractures without comminution or instability - tension band wiring, plate fixation, or an intramedullary rod\nComminuted fractures and fractures with elbow instability - plate fixation\nOsteoporotic patients with significant comminution - excision of the olecranon and triceps advancement\nInjuries of hand\nQuestion 1:\nIdentify the carpal bone that is most commonly fractured after fall on an outstretched hand.\n",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe scaphoid (labelled as A) is the most commonly fractured carpal bone after a fall on an outstretched hand.\nIt is more susceptible to fracture because it lies obliquely across the two rows of carpal bones. It also lies along the line of loading (i.e, in the line of weight transmission) between the forearm and thumb. A combination of forced carpal movement and compression, such as in a fall on the dorsiflexed (outstretched) hand, exerts severe stress on the scaphoid making it liable to fracture.\nDue to its blood supply originating from the dorsal distal pole, the scaphoid's proximal pole possesses a poor blood flow, making it less prone to heal and resulting in non-union.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe given clinical presentation and the x-ray are suggestive of scaphoid fracture. Nonunion is a common complication of this condition, while malunion is rare.\nScaphoid fracture characteristically presents with tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox following a fall on an outstretched hand.\nRecent fractures are less likely to be visible on AP view x-ray, hence oblique x-ray view is preferred. Common complications of scaphoid fracture include:\nNon-union and delayed union\nAvascular necrosis\nWrist osteoarthritis Treatment includes:\nUndisplaced fractures - immobilization in a scaphoid cast applied in a glass-holding position\nDisplaced fractures - open reduction and internal fixation using Herbert's screw The below image shows a Herbert screw.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe proximal fragment of the scaphoid undergoes avascular necrosis following a fracture.\nThis is because the blood supply of the scaphoid is from its distal end to the proximal end. A fracture disrupts the blood supply to the proximal part.\nSolution to Question 4:\nAmong the given options, statement A is incorrect.\nA fall on a dorsiflexed hand may tear the tough ligaments that normally bind the carpal bones, leading to dislocations. In peri-lunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position in the lunate fossa of the distal radius but the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. It is frequently associated with compression of the median nerve.\nPrompt reduction reduces swelling and potential damage to the median nerve. The Tavernier maneuver is the most commonly used method of closed reduction. It involves locking the capitate into the distal concavity of the lunate. If the injury cannot be reduced using this method, urgent reduction in the theater should be performed.\nIn lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates anteriorly while the rest of the carpal bones remain in place.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nTerry\u2013Thomas sign is most likely to be seen in patients with scapholunate instability.\nIt denotes the increased gap between the scaphoid and the lunate. A scapholunate gap of &gt;3 mm is suggestive of instability. It results from tearing of the scapholunate ligament following a fall on an outstretched hand.\nThe given x-ray shows the Terry-Thomas sign. The sign is named after Terry Thomas, a British comedian with a visible gap between his two maxillary central incisors.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given scenario and radiograph point to a diagnosis of Bennett\u2019s fracture.\nBennett's fracture is an oblique, simple intra-articular fracture of the base of the first metacarpal bone.\nThe given image shows Bennett's fracture.\n\nOption B: Rolando\u2019s fracture is an intra-articular comminuted fracture of the base of the first metacarpal.\nOption C: Boxer's fracture is the fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck. Option D: Chauffeur fracture is a fracture of the radial styloid process.\nSolution to Question 7:\nBennett's fracture is difficult to maintain in a reduced state due to the pull of the abductor pollicis longus tendon on the shaft of the first metacarpal.\nThe small fractured fragment remains in contact with the trapezium but the rest of the metacarpal shaft is pulled proximally by the abductor pollicis longus tendon that is attached to its base.\nIn contrast, the comminuted fracture line of Rolando's fracture prevents the pull of the abductor pollicis longus tendon from being exerted on the metacarpal shaft.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given scenario and image showing an extra-articular fracture of the fifth metacarpal\nneck points to boxer's fracture. The strength of grip decreases in this fracture as the fourth and fifth fingers are responsible for the power grip of the hand.\nBoxer's fracture is caused by striking an object with a closed fist, as seen in boxing, or occasionally by a direct injury.\n\n\nThe POP cast is applied in James' position/the position of safe immobilization for metacarpal fractures. Position of safe immobilization:\nWrist slightly extended\nMCP joints in full flexion and the IP joints extended\nThumb in abduction\nThis prevents stiffness and contractures as the ligaments are at their longest in this position.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given radiograph showing a fracture of the radial styloid process points to a diagnosis of Chauffeur's fracture.\nIt is caused either by direct trauma to the wrist or traumatic radial deviation of the wrist.\nOption A: Barton's fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with volar subluxation of the wrist.\nOption C: Smith's fracture is a distal radial fracture with associated volar angulation of the distal fracture fragment. It is also called reverse Colles fracture.\nOption D: Rolando\u2019s fracture is an intra-articular comminuted fracture of the base of the first metacarpal.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given scenario and image showing a flexed fingertip are suggestive of a mallet finger. It results from sudden, forced flexion of the fingertip.\nMallet finger is also known as baseball finger. It is caused by the disruption of the extensor tendon at the distal interphalangeal joint. This leads to unopposed action of flexor tendon resulting in a flexed fingertip. Passive extension of the distal interphalangeal joint is preserved.\n\nDorsal hyperextension splints are used for immobilization of the joint. The given image shows a hyperextension splint.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of a jersey finger. Avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon from the distal phalanx results in this condition.\nThis injury commonly occurs in rugby and football players. Patients are unable to flex the distal end of the finger.\nOption B: Boutonniere\u2019s deformity presents as a flexion deformity of the PIP joint and extension of the DIP joint. It occurs as a result of the rupture of the middle slip of the extensor tendon followed by the separation of the lateral slips. The head of the proximal phalanx thrusts through this gap like a button through a buttonhole.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given scenario and image showing an increased opacity of lunate due to interrupted blood supply is suggestive of Keinbock\u2019s disease.\nKeinbock's disease refers to the avascular necrosis of the lunate leading to progressive wrist pain. Patients present with tenderness over the lunate and stiffness of the wrist joint.\nOption A: Sever disease or calcaneus apophysitis refers to the inflammation of the calcaneus growth plate in growing children.\nOption C: Kohler's disease refers to the avascular necrosis of the navicular bone.\nOption D: Osgood-Schlatter disease/ tibial tubercle apophysitis refers to the inflammation of the patellar ligament at the tibial tuberosity. It is characterized by a painful swelling just below the knee. It worsens with activity and is relieved by rest.\nRegional conditions of the upper limb\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following patients are unlikely to develop a frozen shoulder?",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nPsoriasis has no association with frozen shoulder.\nFrozen shoulder is defined as the disorder characterized by progressive pain and stiffness in the shoulder joint which spontaneously resolves after around 18 months.\nAssociated conditions include:\nDiabetes mellitus\nCervical disc disease\nHyperthyroidism\nProlonged immobilization\nStroke or myocardial infarction\nSolution to Question 2:\nEmpty can test is used to assess supraspinatus muscle.\nIn this test, the patient is asked to resist the downward force by the examiner, when the arms are in the position of 90\u00b0 abduction, 30\u00b0 flexion, and complete internal rotation. The result is positive if the affected side is weaker than the normal side.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon is responsible for painful arc syndrome rather than a complete tear.\nPainful arc syndrome, also known as impingement syndrome is a condition where there is pain in the shoulder and upper arm during the mid-range of shoulder abduction (between 60-120 degrees), arising due to repetitive rubbing of the supraspinatus tendon under the coracoacromial arch.\nCauses include:\nMinor tears of the supraspinatus tendon\nSupraspinatus tendinitis\nCalcification of supraspinatus tendon\nFracture of greater tuberosity\nSubacromial bursitis\nImportant tests for impingement are:\nPainful arc test\nHawkin-Kennedy's test\nNeer's impingement sign\nJobe's test Investigations:\nAn x-ray of the shoulder helps to detect bony avulsions, spurs, calcific deposits, sclerotic areas etc.\nUltrasound of the shoulder joint is highly reliable with a sensitivity of 98%.\nSingle contrast arthrogram is considered the gold standard in diagnosing rotator cuff tears Management:\nConservative: heat massage, exercises, NSAIDs, subacromial steroid injections, and temporary immobilization (90% of patients recover with these measures).\nIndications for surgery include failure of conservative measures for 3 months, increasing loss of shoulder function, and patients who are young and active.\nSurgical techniques include excision of adhesions and manipulation of the shoulder, excision of calcium deposits, repair of incomplete tear, acromioplasty, acromionectomy for more disabling pain with normal range of movements, direct suture for complete rupture of the rotator cuff, rotation and transposition of the flap, and free graft.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given image is suggestive of olecranon bursitis. It is also known as Draughtman's elbow/student's elbow/ miner's elbow.\nOlecranon bursitis is a chronic inflammation of the olecranon bursa, as a result of repetitive minor injuries. It is seen in people who tend to keep their elbow rubbed against the desk. The constant friction against the olecranon bursa can lead to the development of bursitis.\nCulture and aspiration of the bursa fluid are done to rule out infection. Most cases can be managed conservatively with NSAIDs and local steroids. A chronically enlarged bursa will require excision.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe Tendon of Extensor carpi radialis is most commonly involved in tennis elbow.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario along with positive Cozen's test is suggestive of tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis).\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of Golfer's elbow. Mills sign is positive in Tennis elbow.\nGolfer's elbow is due to inflammation at the medial epicondyle, where the pronator muscles have their origin. It is also known as swimmer's elbow. It is less common than tennis elbow.\nTenderness is localized over the medial epicondyle. There is pain on resisted forearm pronation in extension. Ulnar nerve entrapment at the medial epicondyle can result in neuropathy symptoms.\nMost of the cases are managed conservatively by activity modification and pain killers.\nSolution to Question 8:\nDe Quervain's disease classically affects extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus.\nDe Quervain's disease is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the extensor tendons of the first dorsal compartment, namely extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL). It involves noninflammatory thickening of both the tendons and the tunnel or sheath through which they pass. This condition is prominent among females, especially women of childbearing age.\nKey diagnostic factors:\nHistory of joint overuse at home or at work.\nPain and tenderness at the tip of the radial styloid.\nPositive Finkelstein test: The examiner grasps the thumb of the patient and abducts the hand towards the ulnar side. This causes severe pain over the tip of the styloid process\n\nTreatment in most patients includes conservative management with splinting and steroid injections. Only a few patients require surgical release of the 1st dorsal compartment (housing the APL and EPB tendons).\nSolution to Question 9:\nFinkelstein's test is negative ulnar nerve entrapment. Finkelstein's test:\nExaminer holds the patient\u2019s hand with his thumb tucked firmly and then flexes into the palm; then turn the wrist into full ulnar deviation; in a positive test, this will elicit sharp pain in the affected sheath. The pain over the radial styloid tip is excruciating.\nIt is positive in the following conditions:\nDe Quervain's tenosynovitis\nArthritis in the intercarpal and radiocarpal joints\nRadial nerve entrapment\nIntersection syndrome i.e. tenosynovitis occurring due to friction between the obliquely placed extensor and abductor pollicis tendons and the longitudinally placed extensor tendons.\nFinkelstein stated that this test is \u201cprobably the most pathognomonic objective sign\nNote: Finkelstein's test is commonly confused with Eichhoff's test: Eichhoff's test is typically described as the examiner ulnar deviating the hand when the person has their thumb held within their fist. If sharp pain occurs along the distal radius, De Quervain's tenosynovitis is suspected.\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe clinical scenario along with the video showing the middle finger in the flexed position requiring extra force to extend it is suggestive of a trigger finger.\nTrigger finger is caused by stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor sheath. There is nodular or fusiform swelling on the flexor tendon that prevents it from moving along the A1 pulley.\nA1 pulley is an annular ligament that acts as a belt that straps the flexor tendon to the underlying phalanges. There are 5 annular ligaments in each finger namely A1. A2, A3, A4, and A5.\nThe image given below is showing the nodule in the flexor tendon and the 5 annular ligaments of the finger.\n\nWhen the finger is flexed or extended, the nodular swelling passes through the A1 pulley with a snap, leading to a triggering effect. The nodule can get trapped behind the A1 pulley leading to a locking of the finger in flexion.\nSurgical treatment involves the release of the A1 pulley, which is thickened and fibrosed.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe condition shown above is Dupuytren's contracture. A radiograph would be the least useful in the diagnosis of this condition.\nIn Dupuytren's contracture, there is proliferating fibroplasia of the subcutaneous palmar tissue, forming nodules. It is more commonly seen in males.\nIt results in:\nFinger contractures\nThinning of subcutaneous fat\nPitting of skin and knuckle pads The possible causes are:\nInheritance\nPhenytoin therapy\nDiabetes mellitus\nSmoking\nEpileptics and alcoholics.\nThough surgery is the treatment of choice, it is delayed until the contractures develop. Treatment of Dupuytren Disease:\nNonoperative:\nExternal beam radiation\nSteroid injection\nCollagenase Operative:\nSubcutaneous fasciotomy\nStaged external fixation\nArthrodesis\nAmputation\nSolution to Question 12:\nGamekeepers thumb results due to the rupture of ulnar collateral ligament of thumb metacarpophalangeal joint. The volar plate is not involved in partial rupture, it is involved only in complete rupture.\nIt can be caused either by fall on extended thumb (forcing it into hyperabduction) or by repeated valgus stress (i.e. radial deviation) on the thumb which occurs during twisting movement of the hand. This type of injury was seen in gamekeepers who used to twist the neck of small animals with their thumb and index finger.\nThe ulnar collateral ligament keeps the thumb stable in flexion and the volar plate keeps the thumb stable in extension.\nIn a partial rupture:\nOnly the ligament is torn and the thumb is unstable only in flexion\nThe volar plate is intact, keeping the thumb stable in extension In a complete rupture:\nBoth the ligament and the volar plate are torn\nThe thumb is unstable in all positions\nDislocations of the Hip joint\nQuestion 1:\nWhich is the most common type of dislocation of the hip?\nPosterior dislocation\nAnterior dislocation\nCentral dislocation\nMedial dislocation\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is likely to be seen in patients with dashboard injury?",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe posterior dislocation is the most common type of dislocation of the hip. There are three types of dislocations of the hip:\nPosterior - seen in motor vehicle accidents where the flexed knee of the passenger hits the dashboard\nAnterior - seen in high energy injuries when the patient falls from the height\nCentral - seen when there is a blow over the greater trochanter or fall on the side\nSolution to Question 2:\nDashboard injury can lead to:\nPosterior hip dislocation\nPatellar fracture\nFracture of neck of femur\nAcetabular fracture\nShaft of femur fracture\nPosterior cruciate ligament injury\nDashboard injury occurs when the knee is flexed and the hip of the driver/passenger thrusts forward against the dashboard of the car in road traffic accidents. Posterior dislocation is most common in this type of injury.\nDashboard injury in a flexed knee in neutral adduction causes simple posterior dislocation. Whereas, if there is slight abduction, posterior fracture-dislocation occurs.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of posterior hip dislocation. In this condition, the leg will be in flexion, adduction and internal rotation.\nThe femoral artery pulsation is usually felt against the neck of the femur. Due to the posterior dislocation of the hip joint, the femoral vessels fall backwards and the pulsation of the femoral artery cannot be felt. This is called as vascular sign of Narath.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe radiograph of the patient's pelvis following a road traffic accident reveals upward and lateral dislocation of the left femoral head, accompanied by an obscured lesser trochanter, indicating a posterior dislocation of the left hip.\nPosterior hip dislocation is commonly seen following dashboard injuries and the patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb.\nRadiological findings:\nLoss of continuity of acetabulum with the femoral head (break in Shenton's line)\nUpward and lateral displacement of the femoral head\nThe femoral head appears smaller than normal\nThe lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated\nFemoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen\nThe image below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line:\n\nTreatment:\nAn early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time.\nClosed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an associated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.\nIn closed reduction the following steps are done:\nThe pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee flexed at 90 degrees. The hip is then flexed maintaining the traction along with internal rotation and adduction. This is called Allis' maneuver. The below image describes this technique:\n\nOther methods of closed reduction include - Stimson's maneuver, East Baltimore lift maneuver, and Bigelow's maneuver.\nAfter reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 90 degrees, and a longitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. While performing this the joint is monitored in an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. In case of evidence of subluxation or any significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical correction, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done.\nIf there is damage to the acetabulum, or intervening structures between the femoral head and the acetabular surface are present - open reduction can be considered.\nEarly complications:\nSciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 10-20% of the cases\nVascular injury - Superior gluteal artery tear can occur\nConcurrent femoral shaft fracture - When both occur together hip dislocation may be missed Late complications:\nOsteonecrosis of the femoral head\nMyositis ossificans\nSecondary osteoarthritis\nRecurrent instability\nSolution to Question 5:\nIn posterior dislocation of the hip, the lesser trochanter is not visualized in the radiograph. This is due to the internal rotation of the limb.\nIn posterior dislocation of the hip, there is disruption of Shenton line. It is an imaginary curved line drawn along the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and along the inferomedial border of the neck of femur. This line is continuous and smooth.\nIt is usually disrupted in:\nDislocation of the hip\nFracture neck of femur\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hip\nThe image given below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nKocher\u2019s maneuver is used for the management of shoulder dislocation.\nReduction of hip dislocation (closed or open) should ideally be performed within 6 hours to prevent osteonecrosis of the hip joint.\nMethods of closed reduction for posterior hip dislocation are:\nAllis maneuver- traction applied opposite to the direction of deformity\n\nStimson maneuver- downward pressure to the flexed knee (patient is prone and at the edge of the table)\n\nBigelow maneuver- longitudinal traction with pressure on ASIS to stabilize the pelvis\n\nEast Baltimore lift maneuver- anterior force on the flexed knee (doctor's and assistant's place hands below the flexed knee)\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe above radiograph shows posterior dislocation of the hip joint. The pain is due to sciatic nerve injury which is a complication in this type of dislocation.\nComplications of posterior hip dislocation are:\nSciatic nerve injury\nInjury to superior gluteal artery\nOsteonecrosis of femoral head\nSecondary osteoarthritis\nMyositis ossificans\nRecurrent instability of the reduced dislocation\nSolution to Question 8:\nIn the given image, the affected leg is in the state of flexion, abduction and external rotation\n(FABER). This type of attitude of the leg is seen in anterior dislocation of the hip.\nAccording to the position assumed by the femoral head, anterior dislocation of the hip can further be classified as superior and inferior.\nSuperior or pubic type - femoral head can be palpated anteriorly\nInferior or obturator type - femoral head can be palpated in the groin The image given below shows anterior dislocation of both hip joints.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of anterior dislocation of the hip as there is\nthe lengthening of the limb. In this condition, the femoral head appears larger than the unaffected side on the X-ray.\nIn the inferior type of anterior dislocation, the femoral head is felt in the groin. Radiographical features include:\nFemoral head appears larger than the unaffected side\nFemoral head may be seen inferior to the acetabulum\nLesser trochanter is prominent Complications of anterior dislocation include:\nInjury to femoral vessels\nInjury to femoral nerve\nIrreducibility\nPost-traumatic osteoarthritis\nAseptic necrosis\nRecurrent dislocation Methods of reduction include:\nStimson's gravity method\nAlli's manoeuvre\nReverse Bigelow's manoeuvre\nThe image given below shows anterior hip dislocation. The limb is abducted and the femoral head is displaced inferiorly.\n\nTreatment of anterior dislocation includes a closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia. If closed reduction fails, an open procedure may be planned.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of central dislocation of the hip as the femoral head is palpated per rectal examination. The most common mechanism for this type of injury is a side blow over the greater trochanter or a fall on the side.\nIt is a type of fracture-dislocation where the femoral head is forced medially through the floor of the acetabulum. Hence, the femoral head can be palpated on per rectal examination.\nThe image given below shows central fracture-dislocation of the hip.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nExternal rotation of hip is being tested in the given image.\nRotatory movements of the hip joint can be measured with the knee flexed or extended. However, more precise measurements are obtained when the rotation is tested with the flexed knee. The procedure involves the following steps.\nThe patient is made to lie supine.\nThe examiner holds the knee with one hand and ankle with the other hand.\nThe knee and hip are flexed to 90 degrees.\nRotation movement is produced at the hip joint by stabilising the knee and moving the leg as the lever.\nIf the hip is rotated such that the leg moves medially, external rotation of the hip occurs.\nIf the hip is rotated such that the leg moves laterally, internal rotation of the hip occurs.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe test being performed by the examiner is Hoover's test. This test is useful in differentiating between the organic and functional causes of limb weakness.\nHoover's test involves the following steps:\nThe examiner places both their hands under the heels of the patient.\nThe patient is asked to flex the affected hip while keeping the knee extended.\nDownward pressure in the healthy limb is felt by the examiner in an organic cause of limb weakness and in healthy individuals. This pressure is not felt in the functional cause of limb weakness and malingering.\nIn a normal individual, when raising one leg by flexing at the hip, the other limb exerts a downward pressure which can be felt at the ankle.\n\nThe McBride's test, Waddell\u2019s test, and O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s test are other examination techniques that help in distinguishing between organic and non-organic causes of lower back pain.\nFractures of femur\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following factors increases the risk of femoral neck fractures?\nHypoparathyroidism\nProton pump inhibitors\nHypertension\nIncreased levels of physical activity\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following classifications is not used for neck of femur fractures?\nPauwels classification\nGarden classification\nDelbet classification\nNeer's classification\nQuestion 3:\nThe X-ray of a patient with femoral neck fracture showed that all 3 sets of trabeculae were out of alignment. Which Garden's stage of fracture shows this finding?\nStage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nQuestion 4:\nWhich of the following statements is true regarding Pauwel's classification of neck of femur fractures?\nPauwel's angle is directly proportional to stability\nType 2 fracture makes an angle of 60 degrees\nPlane of reference is the horizontal plane\nPauwel's angle is formed by fracture line with inter-trochanteric line\nQuestion 5:\nAn elderly patient slipped in the bathroom and sustained injury over the left hip. The radiograph is shown below. His attitude of the leg will be:\n\nShortened and abducted\nLengthened and internally rotated\nShortened and externally rotated\nFlexed, adducted and internally rotated\nQuestion 6:\nA 70-year-old lady, a known case of chronic osteoarthritis of the hip, has a trivial fall while climbing the stairs. Her right lower limb is in slight external rotation. X-ray pelvis is shown below. What is the next step of management?\n\nOpen reduction and internal fixation\nClosed reduction and internal fixation\nHemi-arthroplasty\nTotal arthroplasty\nQuestion 7:\nWhich of the following is most commonly used for internal fixation of fracture of femoral neck in young adults?\nCannulated cancellous screws\nDynamic hip screw\nAustin Moore implant\nHerbert screw\nQuestion 8:\nA 55-year-old woman presents with complaints of right-sided hip pain and restriction of movements of the right lower limb for 3 weeks.

What is the next step in management?\nOpen reduction and internal fixation\nMc Murray's osteotomy\nHemi-arthroplasty\nTotal hip arthroplasty\nQuestion 10:\nWhich of the following statements is false regarding McMurray's osteotomy?\nIt is an oblique osteotomy in the inter-trochanteric region\nIt involves lateral displacement and adduction of the distal fragment\nThe line of weight bearing after the osteotomy passes from the head to the distal fragment\nIt converts shearing stress to compressive forces\nQuestion 11:\nA 35-year-old woman with a history of ORIF for femoral neck fracture came for\npost-operative follow up after 7 months. She is unable to bear weight on the operated side. Her X-ray showed no evidence of healing. Which of the following is not a probable cause for this condition?\nImproper immobilization\nAvascularity of the femoral head\nInterference of synovial fluid\nHypertrophy of cambium layer of periosteum\nQuestion 12:\nWhich of the following is false about the condition shown in the image below?\n\nMalunion can happen if this condition is not treated\nThe patient may be able to walk\nAvascular necrosis is the most common complication\nShortening of limb is less than 1 inch\nQuestion 13:\nWhich of the following is false about avascular necrosis?\nIt can be diagnosed on X-ray only after 4 years\nIt can also occur in united fracture neck of femur\nSubcapital type has worse prognosis\nPatients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk\nQuestion 14:\nA 35-year-old man is brought to the casualty with a history of RTA. His left lower limb is shortened by 2 inches. The attitude of the leg is extension and externally rotated, with the lateral border of the foot touching the bed. What is the most probable diagnosis?\nInter-trochanteric fracture femur\nFracture neck of femur\nFemoral shaft fracture\nAnterior dislocation of hip\nQuestion 15:\nA 69-year-old woman sustains an injury to the left hip after falling sideways on the floor. She is unable to move the left leg. X-ray is given below.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe use of proton pump inhibitors is a risk factor for femoral neck fractures.\nFemoral neck fracture is a type of intracapsular hip fracture. Common risk factors for hip fractures include:\nIncreasing age\nFemale sex\nWhite population of Europe and North America\nSmoking\nDecreased level of physical activity Comorbidities that can cause hip fractures are:\nHIV\nCeliac disease\nDiabetes mellitus\nHypo and hyperthyroidism\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism\nChronic kidney and liver disease Drugs that can cause hip fractures are:\nCorticosteroids\nProton pump inhibitors\nAntipsychotic medication\nAromatase inhibitors\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone inhibitors\nLong-acting progesterone-only pills\nSolution to Question 2:\nNeer's classification is used for proximal humeral fractures. Classifications used for neck of femur fracture are:\nBased on the location of the fracture line\nPauwels classification\nGarden classification\nDelbet classification (hip fractures in the pediatric population) Based on the location of the fracture line it can be classified as:\nSub-capital - fracture at the junction of head and neck\nTranscervical - fracture in the neck\nBasi-cervical - fracture at the base of the neck\n\nDelbet classification is used for hip fractures in children. They are grouped into four types based on their location as follows:\nType I - Transepiphyseal fracture\nType II - Transcervical fracture\nType III - Cervicotrochanteric fracture\nType IV - Intertrochanteric fracture\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn Garden's stage III fracture neck of femur, all the 3 sets of trabeculae are out of alignment. Garden classification of fracture neck of femur is based on the degree of displacement.\nStage I - incomplete fracture line and femoral head is in slight valgus\nStage II - complete fracture line and non-displaced\nStage III - complete fracture line and partially displaced\nStage IV - complete fracture line and completely displaced\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe plane of reference in Pauwel's classification is the horizontal plane. This classification is based on Pauwel's angle i.e. the angle made by the fracture line in reference to the horizontal plane.\n\nWhen the Pauwel's angle is small, compressive forces act at the fracture ends and hence the fracture is stable. As Pauwel's angle increases, the fracture line becomes more vertical and the shearing forces act on the fractured ends. Hence, at higher angles the fracture becomes unstable.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe history of fall and hip injury in an elderly patient along with the radiological findings of a broken Shenton's line is suggestive of a neck of femur fracture. In this condition, the attitude of the leg will be shortened and externally rotated and movements of the hip joint will be painful.\nA plain radiograph may show the following features:\nFracture line in the neck of femur\nExternal rotation of the femur with the lesser trochanter appearing more prominent\nDisplacement of the greater trochanter\nBreak in the trabecular stream\nBreak in Shenton's line\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given scenario and X-ray are suggestive of right-sided fracture neck of femur, Garden stage\nIV. Since the patient is &gt;65 years with existing arthritis, the best choice of treatment is total hip arthroplasty.\nIn the absence of arthritis, fracture neck of femur in patients &gt;65 years, is treated by hemiarthroplasty.\nThe image given below shows total hip arthroplasty done for fracture neck of femur.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most commonly used equipment for internal fixation of fracture neck of femur in young adults is multiple cannulated cancellous screws.\nThe radiograph given below shows internal fixation of the neck of femur fracture with cannulated cancellous screws.\n\nOption B: Dynamic hip screw is used in some cases of fracture neck of femur and for the internal fixation of the intertrochanteric fractures. The image below shows a dynamic hip screw.\n\nOption C: Austin Moore's implant is an older implant used in unipolar hemiarthroplasty. Option D: Herbert screw is used in bridging a scaphoid fracture.\nSolution to Question 8:\nIn the given clinical scenario with a 3-week old femoral head fracture, the next step will be to do an MRI hip. This is to evaluate the femoral head for compromise in the blood supply.\nTreatment of the femoral head fracture depends on the findings seen on an MRI:\nFemoral head shows compromised blood supply - reduction with fibular bone graft or muscle pedicle graft\nFemoral head shows signs of osteonecrosis and acetabulum is normal - hemiarthroplasty\nFemoral head is normal but the fracture is nearly vertical (can develop to non-union)\n- osteotomy\nThe image given below shows osteonecrosis of the femoral head seen on an MRI.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of a 1-month-old Pauwel's type III fracture (&gt;50\u00b0), which is nearly vertical and has an increased chance of non-union. Hence, the best management would be to compress the fractured ends by Mc Murray's osteotomy and internal fixation.\nSolution to Question 10:\nIn McMurray's osteotomy, the distal fragment is displaced medially and is abducted. This converts shearing stresses at the fracture site to compressive forces promoting faster healing.\nMcMurray's osteotomy is an oblique osteotomy directed medially upwards at the inter-trochanteric region. It is based on the biomechanical principle. After the medial\ndisplacement of the femur, the weight-bearing line passes from the head to the distal fragment. It, therefore, bypasses the fracture site.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of non-union of femoral neck fracture after ORIF, as there is no evidence of healing 6-12 months post-operatively. Lack of cambium layer in the periosteum of neck of femur is one of the causes of non-union.\nCauses for non-union in the neck of femur fracture are as follows:\nInadequate blood supply of femoral head\nSince the fracture is intra-articular, the synovial fluid interferes with fracture healing.\nLack of the cambium layer of periosteum, which produces the callus\nInadequate reduction and poor internal fixation\nImproper immobilization\nThe image given below shows (a) non-union of neck of femur fracture, (b) osteotomy to correct the non-union, (c) 5 months post-osteotomy with healed fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe radiograph shows a fracture neck of the femur. Non-union is a complication of this fracture, not malunion.\nMalunion is a complication of inter-trochanteric fractures. Complications of fracture neck of the femur are:\nAvascular necrosis (most common)\nNon-union\nOsteonecrosis of the femoral head may lead to secondary osteoarthritis after many years Option B: In impacted fracture neck of femur, the patient may be able to walk.\nOption D: Shortening of the limb is less than 1 inch in fracture neck of femur.\nSolution to Question 13:\nAvascular necrosis is a late complication of fracture neck of the femur, which can be diagnosed on X-ray only after a few months to 2 years after the injury. Hence, MRI is the best investigation for diagnosis.\nThe amount of vascular damage produced at the time of fracture determines the probability of the development of osteonecrosis. In addition to this, the blood supply to the femoral head may also be disrupted during internal fixation. Hence, avascular necrosis can also occur in united femur fractures.\nMore proximally the fracture is located, worse is the prognosis. Hence, sub-capital fractures have the worst prognosis.\nPatients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk for developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given clinical scenario with the limb shortening &gt;1 inch and pronounced external rotation is suggestive of inter-trochanteric fracture of the femur.\nDifferences between fracture neck of femur and inter-trochanteric fractures:\nOption B: In fracture neck of femur, the limb is in slight external rotation and shortening is &lt;1 inch.\nOption C: In femoral shaft fractures, the limb is shortened with displaced proximal and distal fragments.\nOption D: In anterior dislocation of the hip, the limb is externally rotated. There may be a true lengthening of the limb with the femoral head palpable in the groin.\nFeature\nFracture neck of femur\nInter-trochanteric fracture\nAge\nMore than 50 years\nMore than 60 years\nSex\nCommon in females\nCommon in males\nInjury\nTrivial\nSignificant\nAbility to walk\nMay walk\nUnable to walk\nPain\nMild\nSevere\nSwelling\nNil\nSevere\nEcchymosis\nNil\nPresent\nTenderness\nIn Scarpa's triangle\nOn the greater trochanter\nExternal rotation deformity\nLess than 45 degrees\nMore than 45 degrees (Latera l border of foot touches the b ed)\nShortening\nLess than 1 inch\nMore than 1 inch\nTreatment\nInternal fixation always\nCan be managed in traction\nComplications\nAvascular necrosis and Non- union\nMalunion\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario and the X-ray is suggestive of intertrochanteric fracture of the\nleft femur, which is best treated by closed reduction and internal fixation proximal femoral nail. The image given below shows an intertrochanteric fracture corrected with proximal femoral nail.\n\nThe intertrochanteric fractures of the femur can be treated by:\nInternal fixation with:\nIntramedullary implants - proximal femoral nail and gamma nai\nExtramedullary implants - dynamic hip screw\nTraction:\nRussell's traction\nThomas splint\nCompared to the dynamic hip screw, the intramedullary fixation with proximal femoral nails have smaller incisions, decreased blood loss, decreased femoral neck shortening and decreased risk of infection.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of occult neck of femur fracture, as the X-ray is normal but the attitude of the leg is abnormal. In such cases, MRI is the imaging study of choice.\nBoth CT and MRI can detect the presence of fracture neck of femur. However, MRI can demonstrate the presence of soft tissue problems that can cause hip pain. It also does not expose the patient to radiation. Hence, MRI is preferred over CT in the diagnosis of occult femoral neck fractures.\nTechnetium bone scan is an older method to detect occult fractures. They are less specific and may not show the presence of fracture if performed within 48-72 hours and in osteopenic bones.\nSolution to Question 17:\nIn the fracture of midshaft of the femur, the distal fragment is adducted as the adductors and the gastrocnemius are attached to the lower part of femur.\nThe proximal fragment is flexed and externally rotated as the gluteus medius and iliopsoas muscles are attached to the upper part of femur.\n\n\nDisplacement of fracture frag ments in the fracture shaft of femur\nSite of fracture\nDisplacement of the proximal segment\nDisplacement of distal fragm ent\nProximal femoral shaft fractu res\nFlexed, abducted and externa lly rotated\nAdducted\nMid-shaft femoral fractures\nFlexed and externally rotated with minimal abduction\nAdducted\nDistal femoral shaft fractures\nAdducted\nTilted by gastrocnemius pull\nSolution to Question 18:\nFrom the given options, maximum shortening of the lower limb is seen in the Inter-trochanteric fracture femur.\nOverall, the maximum shortening of lower limbs is seen in posterior dislocation of the hip followed by Inter-trochanteric fracture femur.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe above radiograph shows a fracture in the shaft of femur with the displacement of fractured ends. The preferred method of treatment in this condition is an intramedullary nail with locking screws.\nOption A: Plating can be done in cases of comminuted fractures.\nOption C: External fixation is preferred in the treatment of severe open injuries, or when there is a severe bone loss that may require a bone graft.\nOption D: Thomas splint is used in the emergency treatment of shaft of femur fracture and some supracondylar fractures.\nThe main indications for traction are:\nfractures in children\ncontraindications to anaesthesia or surgery\nlack of suitable skill or facilities for internal fixation\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe preferred treatment in children of ages 5-10 years with fracture shaft of the femur is elastic intramedullary nailing.\nThe image given below shows fracture shaft of femur treated with elastic intramedullary nailing.\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nIn this clinical scenario, the presence of reduced SpO2 and altered mental status in a patient presenting within 72 hours following a long bone fracture suggests the diagnosis of a fat embolism.\nFat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the bone marrow following the fracture of long bones. Clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen within 72 hours. They include tachycardia, fever, breathlessness, petechiae, confusion,and restlessness. Gurd's criteria is used for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.\nThere is no specific diagnostic test for fat embolism. However, urine analysis to detect fat globules and monitoring of blood pO2 levels are conducted.\nThe management of fat embolism primarily involves supportive care, including oxygen therapy and prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures.\nOption A: Pulmonary embolism most commonly occurs as a result of thrombi from deep vein thrombosis of the leg.\nOption C: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is diagnosed using the Berlin's criteria. All four of the following conditions must be met:\nIt develops within 1 week of clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms.\nChest radiograph shows bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. These opacities are not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules.\nThe edema is not due to cardiac failure, or fluid overload.\nThere is impaired oxygenation. The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) is \uf0a3 300 mmHg as assessed on 5 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).\nOption D: Occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms or plain radiography, but is detected with CT imaging. It usually follows a thoracic injury.\nSolution to Question 22:\nFat globules in sputum is a minor criterion for diagnosing fat embolism.\nInjuries of knee, leg and foot\nQuestion 1:\nInsall-Salvati index is associated with which of the following bones?\nTibia\nPatella\nFibula\nFemur\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is the most common type of patellar fracture?\nPolar\nTransverse\nComminuted displaced\nComminuted undisplaced\nQuestion 3:\nA 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with pain and swelling of the right knee.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe Insall-Salvati index is used for the determination of patellar height.\nIt is the ratio of the patella tendon length (LT) to the length of the patella (LP). It can be measured from a lateral radiograph of the knee.\nRatio between 0.8 and 1.2 - normal\nRatio above 1.2 - high lying patella (patella alta)\nRatio below 0.8 - low lying patella (patella baja)\nThe high and low-lying patella are usually associated with anterior knee pain and recurrent dislocations of the patella.\nThe image below is the radiograph of the knee showing the calculation of Insall-Salvati index.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nTransverse fractures are the most common types of patellar fractures. Patellar fractures are classified as:\nTransverse\nVertical\nPolar\nComminuted fractures\nThese fractures may be either undisplaced or displaced.\nThe tendon of the quadriceps muscle is attached to the upper surface of the patella. These fractures are usually caused by the excessive pull of the quadriceps muscle, either due to excessive contractions or sudden resisted extension of the knee.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe radiograph shows a displaced patellar fracture. The best treatment for the given condition is tension band wiring with K- wires. In this method, two K-wires are used to transfix the reduced patellar fragments and a flexible wire is looped around them tightly.\n\nTreatment options for patellar fracture are:\nUndisplaced patellar fractures with minimal joint incongruity and intact extensor retinaculum\n- cylinder cast\nDisplaced patellar fractures - tension band wiring\nSeverely comminuted fractures with difficulty in reducing fragments - patellectomy\nNote: Tension band wiring with cancellous screw is done when compressive forces are also needed along with tensile forces to resist the displacement of fractures e.g., olecranon fractures.\nSolution to Question 4:\nFracture of lower end of femur and upper end of tibia can result in a floating knee.\nIt refers to the knee that is separated from the femur and tibia. It usually results from motor vehicle accidents.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe mechanism of injury in the fracture of the lateral condyle of the tibia is a combination of axial loading and valgus force.\nThe lateral condyle fractures usually occur when the bumper of a vehicle strikes the pedestrian's knee. The weight of the person is the axial force, and the lateral blow by the vehicle is the valgus force acting on the tibial condyle. These forces together lead to the crushing of the lateral tibial condyle by the lateral femoral condyle.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nHoffa fracture is the intraarticular fracture of femoral condyles in a coronal plane. These are a variant of supracondylar fractures.\nThe given image shows mediolateral radiographs of the knee joints showing a bilateral Hoffa fracture of the medial femoral condyle. (A) right knee; (B) left knee.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nPilon fracture refers to a comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal tibia.\nThese fractures are most often due to high-energy trauma such as a motor vehicle accident or a fall from a height.\nThe below image shows Pilon fracture.\n\nOption A: Tillaux fracture is avulsion fracture of the tibia by the anterior tibiofibular\nligament. common in children, unusual injuries of the growing ankle. Fragment is the lateral part of the epiphysis and the injury is therefore a Salter\u2013Harris type 3 fracture.\nOption B: Rolando's fracture is an intra-articular comminuted fracture of the base of the first metacarpal with a T or Y configuration.\nOption C: Hutchinson fracture is a fracture of the radial styloid.\nSolution to Question 8:\nClosed intramedullary nailing is the preferred treatment for a displaced fracture of the tibial shaft.\nUndisplaced fractures can be treated by closed reduction with full length cast from the upper thigh to the metatarsals. After 4-6 weeks when the fractures become sticky, the above-knee cast is removed and replaced by the below-knee cast (patellar tendon bearing cast).\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario, with a history of lower limb overuse (marathon running) and pain along the medial tibial border which increases with activity (jogging and long walks), along with a normal radiograph, suggests medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints.\nMTSS is a stress injury of the tibia which occurs due to the frequent overuse of lower limbs. It is commonly seen in athletes and military personnel.\nExercise-induced pain along the distal two-thirds of the medial tibial border is typical. Since it is a stress injury, the radiograph of the leg appears normal.\nManagement is mainly conservative with rest and activity modification with less repetitive and load-bearing exercises.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe structures injured in a trimalleolar fracture of the ankle (Cotton's fracture) are medial and lateral malleoli with the posterior aspect of the tibia.\nThe posterior aspect of the distal tibia contains a bony projection known as the posterior malleolus.\nFracture of the ipsilateral medial and lateral malleoli is known as a bimalleolar fracture (Pott's fracture).\nAnkle fractures are unstable fractures and usually require surgical fixation with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).\nSolution to Question 11:\nOttawa ankle rules are used in patients with ankle injuries to determine the need for radiographs. A radiograph of the ankle is suggested if there is:\nPain around the malleolar zone\nBone tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral or medial malleolus/ base of the 5th metatarsal bone\nAn inability to bear weight immediately after the injury\nInability to walk 4 steps in the emergency department\nSolution to Question 12:\nMarch fracture/stress fracture is seen most commonly in the neck of the second metatarsal bone.\nIt results from long, repeated stresses like prolonged walking or running, usually seen in military men, athletes, and dancers. They may complain of gradual onset of pain over the 2nd metatarsal neck starting 2-4 weeks after the beginning of stressors. On examination, a tender lump may be noted. The x-ray may be normal initially but later show a hairline crack. After a period of 4-6 weeks, a mass of callus can be identified.\nManagement: Reduction and splinting are not necessary as it is an undisplaced fracture. Normal walking is permitted while using an elastic bandage on the forefoot.\nThe below image shows a March fracture of the second metatarsal bone.\n\nNote: According to Campbell orthopedics (14th edition) in March fractures, patients often note the gradual onset of pain directly over the second metatarsal neck region. In Uptodate, it is mentioned that many of the stress fractures occur in the second metatarsal shaft, especially at the neck. Hence, neck is considered a more correct answer than shaft.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe anterior talofibular ligament of the lateral ligament complex is most commonly injured in ankle sprains.\nAnkle sprains are the most common type of sports-related injury. It is caused due to excessive loading on the joint when the ankle is in inversion and plantar flexion.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given scenario and x-ray showing a fracture of the neck of the talus point to a diagnosis of aviator's fracture.\nThese fractures most commonly occur following a high-energy injury causing forced dorsiflexion with axial load. They can be further classified using Hawkin's classification:\nType I - Undisplaced\nType II - Subtalar dislocation\nType III - Subtalar and tibiotalar dislocation\nType IV - Subtalar, tibiotalar, and talonavicular dislocation\nUndisplaced fractures are managed conservatively in a short leg cast for 8-12 weeks and a\nnon-weight bearing cast for 6 weeks. Hawkin's type II-IV are managed by open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF).\nThe below image shows the Hawkins classification of talar neck fractures.\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe radiograph shows the presence of subchondral lucency which is indicative of intact blood supply to the talus. This is known as the Hawkins sign.\nThe presence of this sign excludes the complication of avascular necrosis of the body of the talus. It is usually seen 6 weeks after of the fracture.\nComplications of fracture of the talus are:\nOsteoarthritis of the subtalar joint - most common\nAvascular necrosis of body of the talus\nMalunion\nThe below radiograph shows the presence of subchondral lucency or Hawkins sign.\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe angle shown in the radiograph is Bohler's angle which is used in the assessment of calcaneum fractures.\nIt is the angle formed by two lines that are tangents to the highest points of the anterior and posterior facets of the calcaneum respectively. This angle is decreased in calcaneal fractures.\nCT is the investigation of choice for suspected tarsal fractures. Assessment of the bone cortex is best done by CT. Whereas stress fractures or occult fractures are best assessed by MRI.\n\nA neutral triangle is an area inside the calcaneum, that contains a relatively less amount of trabecular bone. Hence, it is more prone to calcaneal fractures.\n\nOption B: The critical angle of Gissane is formed by the downward and upward slopes of the superior surface of the calcaneum. It is increased in intraarticular fracture of the calcaneum.\n\nOption C: Kite's angle is the angle between the long axis of the talus and the long axis of the calcaneum. The normal Kite's angle is 30-55 degrees. In CTEV, the Kite's angle is less than 25 degrees.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given radiograph showing fracture and dislocation in the tarsometatarsal region points to a diagnosis of Lisfranc's fracture-dislocation.\nThe base of the second metatarsal base is dislocated from the middle cuneiform resulting in the widening of the first intermetatarsal space.\nChopart's fracture-dislocation is the dislocation of the midtarsal joint of the foot. It is associated with the fractures of the calcaneum, cuboid, and navicular bones.\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given scenario and radiograph showing a fracture in zone I of the fifth metatarsal point to a pseudo-Jones fracture.\nThe proximal part of the fifth metatarsal can be divided into three zones:\nZone I - proximal to the fourth and fifth intermetatarsal articulation. Avulsion fractures or pseudo-Jones fractures occur in this zone\nZone II - involves the area of the shaft which articulates with the fourth metatarsal bone. True Jones fractures occur in this zone\nZone III - distal to the fourth and fifth intermetatarsal articulation. Stress fractures occur in this zone\n\nAVN and Regional conditions of lower limb\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following parts of bones are least likely to undergo to avascular necrosis?\nNeck of femur\nProximal pole of scaphoid\nBody of talus\nHead of humerus\nQuestion 2:\nPatients with which of the following conditions are at an increased risk of developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head?\nTay-Sachs disease\nSarcoidosis\nSyphilis\nHIV\nQuestion 3:\nA 47-year-old woman presents with pain in the right hip during ambulation for the past few months. There is no history of trauma. An X-ray done is shown below. Which of the following is the most sensitive investigation to confirm the diagnosis of this condition?\n\nMRI scan\nCT scan\nDEXA scan\nTc bone scan\nQuestion 4:\nAn overweight man (90 kg) presented with complaints of not being able to squat and rest pain of left hip for 6 months duration. He had a past history of steroid and creatine use. His X-ray revealed destruction of the articular surface of femoral head with the presence of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign. His MRI is suggestive of marrow edema. What is your diagnosis?\nTuberculosis of hip\nFracture neck of femur\nOsteochondroma of femur\nOsteonecrosis of femoral head\nQuestion 5:\nFreiberg osteochondritis affects which of the following bones?\nTibial tuberosity\nCalcaneum apophysis\nBody of talus",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nOf the following, the neck of the femur is least likely to undergo Avascular Necrosis (AVN).\nThe fracture of the neck of the femur can most commonly cause AVN of the head of the femur.\nSolution to Question 2:\nPatients with HIV are at an increased risk of developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Etiology of avascular necrosis (primary):\nHIV\nCaisson's disease\nSickle cell disease\nHemoglobinopathies\nHypercoagulable states (Protein C and S deficiency)\nAnti-phospholipids antibody syndrome\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nHyperlipidemia\nGaucher's disease\nSteroids\nRadiotherapy\nChemotherapy\nAlcohol excess\nAvascular necrosis is found in Gaucher disease and not Tay Sachs disease. In Tay-Sachs disease, there is an accumulation of gangliosides mainly in the nerve cells.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe radiograph shows flattening of the femoral head and degenerative changes associated\nwith avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The most sensitive investigation to diagnose avascular necrosis is MRI.\nMRI allows identification of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in earlier stages and also determines the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process.\nThe radiograph below shows the flattening of the femoral head in a patient with avascular necrosis.\n\nThe radiographic appearance of avascular necrosis of the femoral head may show the following changes:\nSclerosis of the femoral head\nFlattening or loss of sphericity of femoral head\nCrescent sign\nIn severe stages, it may show femoral head collapse and arthritic changes in the joint The image given below shows osteonecrosis of the femoral head seen on an MRI.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe complaints of hip pain in an overweight man with a history of long-term steroid use along with the radiological findings of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign in the femoral head are characteristic of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.\nAvascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition that results from diminished blood supply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies. Alcohol, corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, and cytotoxic drugs, either singly or in combination, are the most common causes of non-traumatic osteonecrosis. The typical features are pain with movements in or near the joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements is also a feature of this condition.\nAn x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone, and a distorted articular surface. The crescent sign is a subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic segment of the femoral head seen on radiography. MRI is the investigation of choice in early disease. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process.\n\nManagement is based on Ficat and Arlet Classification:\nOther options:\nOption A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip, especially at night. The radiographic findings are not appreciable in the early stages.

    "question_text": "\nAdvanced arthritis\nReconstructive\nTotal hip replaceme nt\n\nOption B: Fracture neck of femur is common in elderly people after a trivial fall due to osteoporosis. Examination reveals tenderness in the groin along with shortening and external rotation of the leg. Xrays show a break in Shenton\u2019s line and trabecular stream, overriding of greater trochanter so that it lies at the level of the head of the femur, and external rotation of the femur is evident by prominent lesser trochanter.\n\nOption C: Osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral ossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nFreiberg osteochondritis affects the 2nd metatarsal head.\nOsteochondritis or osteochondrosis refers to the condition where there is separation and necrosis of small fragment of articular cartilage and bone.\nSolution to Question 6:\nHaglund deformity, pump bump, or Mulholland deformity is seen around the ankle joint. It refers to retrocalcaneal exostosis formed at the posterosuperior aspect of the calcaneum.\nretrocalcaneal bursa usually protects the Achilles tendon from the calcaneal tuberosity. But in Haglund deformity, there is chronic inflammation of this retrocalcaneal bursa due to increased or repetitive chafing between the tuberosity and Achilles tendon. Due to prolonged inflammation, degenerative changes occur and osteophytes form within the tendon leading to calcification at the site of the tendon insertion. This leads to deformity and pain symptoms.\nManagement is usually conservative, using a heel lift, silicone pads in closed shoes, ice application, anti-inflammatory drugs, and stretching exercises of the calf.\nThe image below shows the Haglund deformity.\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nOsgood-Schlatter disease is the epiphysitis of the tibial tuberosity.\nSolution to Question 8:\nOsteochondritis dissecans is the most common cause of loose bodies in the knee joint of a young individual.\nLoose bodies are fragments of bone, cartilage, or fibrous tissue that are present within the joint cavity. The common causes of loose bodies in the knee joint are:\nOsteochondritis dissecans (most common cause in young)\nOsteoarthritis (most common cause in old)\nRheumatoid arthritis\nCharcot's disease\nOsteochondral fractures\nSynovial osteochondromatosis (associated with multiple loose bodies)\nTubercular arthritis\nForeign bodies like bullets, needles, and broken arthroscopic instruments.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe most common site of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is the lateral part of the medial femoral condyle.\nOsteochondritis dissecans develops in the joint when a small, avascular, well-demarcated fragment gets separated from the surrounding bone. It most commonly occurs in the knee joint.\nOn examination, the patient feels pain when the knee is medially rotated and then extended. On the contrary, the pain is relieved when the knee is laterally rotated and then extended. This is known as Wilson's sign.\nIn the initial stages, it is treated conservatively. In later stages, it is treated either by removal of the fragment or the cartilage repair techniques like microfracture techniques and autologous cartilage implantation.\nSolution to Question 10:\nA low Q angle is not a feature of chondromalacia patellae, on the contrary, it has a high Q angle (quadriceps angle).\nQ angle is the angle made by the line of the quadriceps pull with the patellar tendon. The line of quadriceps pull extends from the middle of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine. Normal range is 14-17 degrees. An angle of more than 20 degrees predisposes to anterior knee pain.\nThis condition is commonly seen in young women and athletes and is mainly caused due to the mechanical overload of the patellofemoral joint.\nPatients commonly present with anterior knee pain. The pain is increased by climbing stairs and standing after prolonged sitting. This is known as the theatre sign or movie sign (pain and stiffness after sitting for a long time in a theatre).\nIt can also be associated with knee swelling and catching sensation (not true locking) of the knee joint.\nIt is treated conservatively by anti-inflammatory medications, avoiding stressful exercises, and physiotherapy.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nBaker's cyst or popliteal cyst is seen in the knee.\nIt is caused usually due to the distension of bursae present in the popliteal fossa or posterior herniation of the synovial membrane of the knee joint. It usually develops as a consequence of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and lesions of the menisci.\nSolution to Question 12:\nJumper's knee is the patellar tendonitis at the tendo-osseous junction of the patella.\nIt is due to the overuse of the patellofemoral extensor mechanism and is commonly seen in athletes.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe deformity shown is the hallux valgus. It is caused due to the excessive lateral deviation of the great toe with the prominence of the head of the first metatarsal.\nIt can be congenital or a consequence of rheumatoid arthritis or excessive usage of footwear with narrow toe space.\nOn the contrary, hallux varus is the excessive medial deviation of the great toe.\n\nIn gout, there is redness and swelling over the first metatarsophalangeal joint but there is no lateral deviation of the toe.\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nHammertoes deformities are due to the flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP).\nThis is usually seen in neuromuscular diseases. In neuromuscular diseases where there is a loss of function of intrinsic muscles of the foot (especially interossei), the flexor digitorum longus causes increased flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint.\nClaw toe is characterized by hyperextension at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and flexion at both IP joints (similar to claw hand)\nMallet toe is characterized by flexion deformity of the distal IP joint (similar to mallet finger).\nThe image below shows hammertoes in a patient.\n\nInjuries of spine\nQuestion 1:\nA patient was brought to the emergency department with an injury to the neck following a road traffic accident.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe nerve root likely injured in a patient having decreased sensation over the back of the scalp is C2.\nArea of loss of sensation following nerve root injury varies depending upon level of nerve root as follows:\nC2 injury leads to decreased sensation over the back of the scalp\nC3 injury leads to decreased sensation over the anterior aspect of the neck\nC4 injury leads to decreased sensation over the lateral aspect of the neck and inferiorly over clavicles down to the rib space\nC5 injury leads to decreased sensation over the deltoid\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe C6 nerve root has been damaged in this case of loss of sensation over the radial aspect of forearm and weakened wrist extension.\nSolution to Question 3:\nDecreased sensation over the medial aspect of the forearm around the elbow is seen due to injury to T1 nerve root.\nT1 is the nerve root for the sensory supply of the medial aspect of the forearm.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe biceps muscle can be used to test the C5 root motor function. It causes elbow flexion.\nIn spine injuries, a full neurological examination is performed in all cases. Tests performed for nerve root motor function are summarized in the table below.\nSpinal Segm ent\nMuscle Supplied\nAction to Test\nC5\nBiceps, Brachialis\nElbow flexion\nC6\nExtensor carpi radialis longu and brevis\nWrist extension\nC7\nTriceps\nElbow extension\nC8\nFlexor digitorum profundus t o the middle finger\nFlex middle distal phalanx\nT1\nAbductor digiti minimi\nAbduct little finger\nL2\nIliopsoas\nFlex hip\nL3\nQuadricep\nStraighten knee\nL4\nTibialis anterior\nDorsiflex foot\nL5\nExtensor hallucis longus\nDorsiflex big toe\nS1\nGastrocnemius, Soleus\nPlantarflex foot\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe bulbocavernous reflex is commonly tested to detect spinal shock.\nSpinal shock is the physiological dysfunction that follows structural injury to the spine. It manifests as flaccidity, loss of sensation, and absence of reflexes below the level of the injury.\nThe primitive reflexes are absent in spinal shock. These include:\nBulbocavernosus reflex (root value S2- S4): Tested by squeezing the penis in males or applying pressure on the clitoris in females. The normal response is the contraction of the anal sphincter. If the patient has in situ Foley's catheter, it can be gently pulled to test anal contraction in both genders.\nAnal wink reflex (root value S2- S4): Tested by stroking the skin around the anus. The normal response is the contraction of the anal sphincter.\nSpinal shock usually lasts less than 48 hours and the reflexes return to normal. Resolution of spinal shock is indicated by the return of the bulbocavernosus and the anal wink reflex.\nThe path of the bulbocavernosus reflex is depicted below.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn cauda equina syndrome, the knee jerk is lost. Causes for cauda equina syndrome include:\nTumours of the spine\nPott's disease\nProtrusion of disc\nFracture-dislocation of the thoracolumbar spine.\nInitially, there is saddle-shaped hyperesthesia and later anesthesia involving buttocks, anus, and perineum. Along with this, there is flaccid paralysis below the knee and ankle reflex is lost.\nBulbocavernosus reflex is also absent.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe quantity of residual urine is large, not minimal, in autonomous bladder.\nDifferences between an automatic bladder and autonomous bladder are highlighted in the table.\nAutomatic bladder\nAutonomous bladder\nLevel of injury above S2\nInjury below/at S2\nUMN type lesion\nLMN type lesion\nControlled by reflex center of bladder\nControlled by intrinsic plexus of bladder\nEmptying is involuntary\nEmptying is voluntary\nAutomatic bladder\tAutonomous bladder\nAutomatic bladder\tAutonomous bladder\nResidual urine volume is min imal\nResidual urine volume is larg e (200-300 cc)\nSolution to Question 8:\nCervical vertebral fracture is not seen in most cases with whiplash injury. It is seen in severe cases only.\nWhiplash is a form of cervical acceleration-deceleration injury. There is hyperextension of the spine followed by flexion during the recoil.\nThe main pathological features seen in these cases include tear (strain) of the anterior longitudinal ligament and the capsular fibres of the facet joints in the spine. In some cases, the intervertebral discs may be damaged.\nSolution to Question 9:\nSCIWORA is Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality. It is very common in children.\nSuch injuries are most often seen in the cervical spine. Specific biomechanics of the vertebral column in children allows the musculoskeletal system to move beyond the normal physiological range of motion without the risk of fracture. However as the spinal cord is not as flexible, neurological deficits may be seen.\nInvestigations available earlier like X-rays could not detect such lesions. However, new imaging modalities like MRI have increased the rate of detection of such lesions and is considered gold standard.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given radiograph is that of open mouth view or odontoid view. The open-mouth view is used to diagnose:\nJefferson fracture - Burst fracture of C1 vertebra\nOdontoid fractures - Fracture of odontoid process of C2 vertebra\nBasilar invagination - Upward migration of superior part of the odontoid proce\nSolution to Question 11:\nIn Jefferson's fracture, the transverse ligament is likely to be ruptured if the combined overhang of C1 lateral processes over C2 is more than 6.9 mm.\nJefferson's fracture is a burst fracture of the ring of the atlas (C1). It occurs due to axial forces and can be stable or unstable as shown below.\n\nJefferson's fracture is identified in an open-mouth X-ray view (odontoid view). The displacement of the lateral process of C1 over C2 is checked in this X-ray to evaluate if the transverse ligament is torn.\nIf the total displacement (sum of displacement on both sides) of C1 lateral masses relative to C2 is more than 6.9 mm, the transverse ligament is likely to be damaged. This is known as the rule of Spence which is used to determine if the fracture is stable or unstable. If the transverse ligament is torn, it is classified as an unstable fracture.\nThe image below depicts the use of the rule of Spence in an odontoid view X-ray.\n\nNote: Some experts suggest that this measurement has to be 8.1 mm to account for magnification on plain radiographs.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image reveals a stable burst fracture (Jefferson fracture) of the ring of the atlas (C1 vertebra). This condition is preferably managed by the application of a rigid cervical collar until the fracture heals.\nThe treatment approach for Jefferson's fracture is as follows:\nStable burst fractures are treated using a rigid cervical collar for 8 to 12 weeks.\nUnstable fractures (with injured transverse ligament assessed by the rule of Spence) may be reduced by halo traction and managed in a halo vest for 12 weeks.\nIf there is a residual C1-C2 instability despite the above treatment, then surgical posterior atlantoaxial fusion (C1-C2 fusion) is performed.\nThe below image shows a rigid cervical collar.\n\nThe image below shows a halo vest.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nHangman's fracture is a fracture of pars interarticularis of axis (C2 vertebra).\nIt is also known as traumatic C2 spondylolisthesis. In most cases, there is no neurological deficit as pars fractures expand the spinal canal.\n\nIn the below X-ray of the cervical spine, a Hangman's fracture can be noted. It can be observed that C2 (red outline) has moved forward with respect to C3 (blue outline).\n\nThe Levine and Edwards classification is used commonly for these fractures.\nMost of these fractures can be managed conservatively. The treatment approach is as below:\nMinimally displaced fractures: Cervical collar.\nHighly displaced and angulated fractures: Traction followed by Halo vest\nFractures with dislocation of the C2\u2013C3 facet joint and neurological injuries: Open reduction and tabilization\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe most common and most dangerous type of odontoid fracture is Type II. These fractures are unstable and prone to non-union.\nOdontoid fractures are classified by Anderson and D\u2019Alonzo classification into 3 types given below:\nType\nFeatures\nManagement\nI\nAvulsion fracture of the tip of the odontoid\nRigid collar\nII\nFracture at the junction of th e odontoid process and the b ody of the axis\nYoung patient and stable frac ture: traction followed by a c ollar or halo vestUnstable fra ctures: anterior odontoid scre w, or C1\u2013C2 fusion\nIII\nFracture through the body of the axis\nUndisplaced fractures: halo v est (8-12 wks)Displaced fract ures: halo traction followed b y halo vest (8-12 weeks)\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nAnderson and D\u2019Alonzo classification is used to determine the management of C2 odontoid process fracture, and not in subaxial cervical spine fractures.\nFor subaxial (C3-C7) cervical injuries, the classification systems used include Ferguson and Allen classification and the subaxial cervical spine injury classification (SLIC).\nManagement of subaxial (C3-C7) injuries: Individual injuries are evaluated based on the three-column biomechanical model and treatment is planned accordingly.\nSingle-column injuries without neurologic deficit are managed with immobilization using a cervical collar.\nTwo-column injuries are considered unstable and tend to be treated operatively, but some of these injuries can be treated with immobilization using a cervical collar. When neurologic deficit are present, operative treatment is recommended.\nThree-column injuries are considered unstable even when there is no neurologic deficit and usually require operative stabilization.\nSolution to Question 16:\nAccording to the Denis three-column theory, the posterior part of the pedicles is included in the posterior column of the spine, not in the middle column.\nThe 3 columns of the spine according to Denis classification are depicted in the image below.\n\nThe Denis classification is used to describe spinal injuries and classify them as stable or unstable. As per this system, any injury involving 2 columns or more is classified as unstable. Unstable injuries require surgical fixation.\nThe current AO/ASIF classification that replaced Denis classification reverts back to the previously prevalent two-column theory. It divides the spine as follows:\nAnterior column: vertebral body and disc\nPosterior column: pedicles, laminae, facets and posterior ligamentous complex\nSolution to Question 17:\nClay-shoveler\u2019s fracture refers to avulsion fracture of the C7 spinous process.\nIt occurs due to the powerful contraction of the back muscles inserted into the spinous process. The injury is painful but harmless. No treatment is usually required. As soon as the pain subsides, neck exercises are encouraged.\nThe X-ray below shows a clay-shoveler's fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nIn the given scenario, the patient has suffered a cervical spinal injury. The AO-Magerl classification is used for the classification of thoracolumbar spinal injuries.\nIn AO-Magerl classification, thoracolumbar injuries are classified into 3 types based on the primary force that caused injury:\nType A (compression force)\nType B (distraction force)\nType C (torsional/rotational force)\nThe various classification systems used to classify cervical spinal injuries include:\nThe Anderson and D'Alonzo classification is used for odontoid fracture in the C2 vertebra.\nThe Levine and Edwards classification is used for Hangman's fracture (traumatic pondylolisthesis of C2 over C3).\nThe Allen and Ferguson classification is used for subaxial cervical spine (C3-C7) injuries.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe given patient has a compression fracture of the L4 vertebra. It can be diagnosed radiographically by the wedge-shape and loss of anterior height compared to the posterior height of the affected vertebra.\nCompression fractures occur due to axial loading of the vertebra. They result from severe spinal flexion. They can also occur with minimal trauma in osteoporotic individuals or as pathological fractures in other conditions.\nThey are characterized by loss of vertebral height anteriorly, with no loss of posterior vertebral height and no posterior ligamentous or bony injury. In most cases, there is no spinal cord damage.\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nA stable thoracolumbar anterior wedge compression fracture without any neurological deficit is preferably treated with external spine support, bed rest, and pain killers.\nManagement of stable vertebral compression fracture is done by application of thoracic lumbar sacral orthosis (TLSO) for 12 weeks with pain management. This is followed by a gradual return to activity.\nSome injuries that are predisposed to further collapse and progressive deformity despite the TLSO includes:\nInjuries that have &gt; 40-50% anterior height lo\nInjuries with &gt; 25 degrees of focal kyphosi\nDisruption of the posterior ligamentous complex\nSigns of instability seen on imaging studie\nThese injuries need to be closely monitored or surgically fixed (Posterior fixation is preferred).\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe given patient has a burst fracture of L4 vertebra.\nThe given lateral view CT image shows that the L4 vertebra has exploded. The posterior border of L4 has lost its concavity and has become convex. There is posterior displacement of the bone into the spinal canal. This is diagnostic of burst fracture of the L4 vertebra with retropulsion.\nBurst fracture results from severe axial compression that explodes the vertebral body. Radiological findings:\nAP view X-rays: Spreading of the vertebral body with an increase of the interpedicular distance may be seen.\nLateral view X-rays: Posterior displacement of bone into the spinal canal (retropulsion) can be een at the posterosuperior border of the vertebral body. The normal concavity of the posterior vertebral body becomes convex in retropulsion.\nManagement of burst fractures:\nStable burst fracture:\nMinimal anterior wedging and posterior ligament complex intact\nNo neurological deficit\nConservatively managed with bed rest until acute symptoms settle, followed by a thoracolumbar brace (TLSO) or body cast for about 12 week\nUnstable burst fracture:\nCases of neurological injury\nDisruption of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC)\nMore than 50% canal compromise on CT\nOperative management done\nPosterior pedicle screw fixation is the standard treatment for PLC disruption\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe X-ray image shows a Chance fracture, which is by definition unstable as it can involve middle and posterior columns.\nChance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack-knife injury. This injury is typically located in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a lap seat-belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posterior distraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis anterior to the vertebral column.\nThere is a tear in the vertebra that passes transversely through the bones (bony Chance fracture), or the ligamentous structures (soft Chance fracture), or both. There is little or no crushing of the vertebral body. However, it is an unstable injury as the posterior and middle columns are distracted. Neurological damage is uncommon. Associated intra-abdominal injuries are seen in 50% of these injuries.\n\nrays may show a horizontal fracture with the split running through the vertebra. It may involve the spinous process, the transverse processes, pedicles and the vertebral body. There may be opening up of the disc space posteriorly.\nMost Chance fractures can be managed conservatively with bed rest and bracing. If posterior fixation is done, it will allow early mobilization. Ligamentous Chance fractures require posterior instrumented fusion.\nSolution to Question 23:\nVertebroplasty is a procedure of injecting liquid bone cement into the vertebral body.\nIn vertebroplasty, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is injected percutaneously into the vertebra through the pedicle to maintain the vertebral height. In kyphoplasty, a balloon is used to expand a compression fracture to regain height before the PMMA is injected.\nIndications for these 2 minimally invasive procedures include:\nPathological vertebral body fractures caused due to osteoporosis, metastatic carcinoma, or multiple myeloma.\nIn some cases of stable compression fractures with no neurological deficits, to manage persistent pain due to the collapse.\nKyphoplasty has been used to correct sagittal deformity and prevent kyphosi\nRisks of these procedures include the possibility of disruption of the posterior cortex and cement material leaking out into the spinal canal and causing neurological deficits. Therefore, these procedures must be done after careful consideration.\nThe below plain X-ray shows the spine of a person who has undergone vertebroplasty.\n\nRegional Conditions of Spine\nQuestion 1:\nA 63-year-old woman presented with low back pain and back stiffness.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray are suggestive of scoliosis. In this condition, the lateral curvature of the spine is &gt; 10 degrees in the coronal plane, in the upright position.\nScoliosis deranges the load and force transmission mechanism through the spine. It is most commonly an idiopathic condition. It jeopardizes the functioning of vital organs like the lungs and heart through overcrowding of ribs.\nMedical intervention is indicated if the lateral curvature is &gt;25 degrees. Various modalities include brace application and surgical correction.\nNote: If the lateral curve of the spine is &lt; 10 degrees then it is known as spinal asymmetry.\nSolution to Question 2:\nIdiopathic scoliosis is the most common type of scoliosis. Scoliosis may be classified as:\nIdiopathic scoliosis - No obvious cause is detected. Several genetic associations have been noted\nCongenital scoliosis - Caused due to failure in vertebra formation or segmentation during development\nNeuromuscular scoliosis - Caused due to neuromuscular disorders like cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, etc.\nScoliosis due to generalized diseases - Seen in conditions such as:\nNeurofibromatosis\nMarfan syndrome\nBone dysplasia\nTumors\nDue to irradiation\nSolution to Question 3:\nRotated vertebrae are seen in structural scoliosis. Scoliosis is classified into 2 types:\nStructural scoliosis - There is a non-correctable deformity due to vertebral rotation in the affected spinal segments\nPostural scoliosis (non-structural) -\nThe deformity is secondary to a condition outside the spine\nSeen in conditions such as:\nShort leg: curvature disappears when the patient is made to sit)\nHip contracture with pelvic tilt: disappears after the disc prolapse is managed)\nLumbar disc prolapse (sciatic scoliosis)\nIf scoliosis is due to poor posture, the deformity disappears when the person is asked to bend forward\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe test shown in the image is Adam's forward bending test. This is the best clinical test for evaluating spinal curvature in scoliosis.\nSteps of Adam's test :\nPatient is asked to bend forward at the waist until the spine is at the horizontal leve\nKnees must be maintained straight, with the feet together, the arms dependent, and the palms in opposition\nExaminer observes the trunk from behind (to assess midthoracic and lumbar rotation) and from the front (to assess upper thoracic rotation)\nIt is used to differentiate between structural and non-structural curves in scoliosis. On bending forward, non-structural scoliosis disappears, while structural scoliosis persists.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe most common type of idiopathic scoliosis is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.\nBased on the age of onset, idiopathic scoliosis is subclassified into 3 types as given below. Note: ASF - Anterior spinal fusion, PSF - Posterior spinal fusion\nInfantile scoliosis\nJuvenile idiopathic scoliosi s\nAdolescent idiopathic scoli osis\nAge of onset\nBirth to 3 years",

The degree of curvature of scoliosis on plain radiographs is measured using Cobb's angle.\nTo measure the Cobbs's angle, first locate the superior-end vertebra and inferior-end vertebra of the curve. Then draw perpendicular lines to the superior surface of the superior-end vertebra and to the inferior surface of the inferior-end vertebra.\nThe angle formed at the intersection of these perpendiculars is the angle of the spinal curve known as Cobb's angle. It can also be measured by measuring the angle made by the intersection of the end-plate lines.\n\nNote: Nash and Moe's method, Perdriolle and Vidal method, and Stokes method are methods of assessing vertebral rotation.\nSolution to Question 8:\nRisser's sign evaluates skeletal maturation using the ossification of the iliac apophysis.\nRisser's sign is used to predict the worsening of scoliosis and in the planning of corrective surgery.\nThe iliac apophysis is divided into four quadrants. The ossification of iliac apophyses normally proceeds from lateral to the medial side i.e., from the anterior superior iliac spine to the posterior superior iliac spine.\nThe Risser sign progresses from grade 0 (no ossification) to grade 4 (all four quadrants have ossified). When the apophysis has fused completely with the ilium, it is Risser grade 5 and the patient is considered skeletally mature.\nRisser's grade 5 (fusion with the ilium) coincides with the fusion of the apophysis in the vertebral ring. After this, there is no possibility of further progression of the scoliosis curve.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nFemales are most commonly affected with idiopathic scoliosis, and female gender is a poor prognostic factor.\nUnfavorable prognostic factors in scoliosis include:\nCongenital or juvenile or paralytic type\nCurve greater than 20-40 degrees\nThoracic curve",

It has a hard polypropylene outer shell with a soft foam lining inside. It is used in patients whose scoliosis curve apex is at T7 or lower.\nBraces are used to prevent progression and avoid surgery in scoliotic curves between 20 and 30 degrees. A variety of braces are available, some are created as cast and some are prefabricated.\nThey usually extend from the thoracic and lumbar spine to the pelvis and have pads to push the spine into correct alignment.\nBraces used in scoliosis:\nMilwaukee brace :\nOriginally designed cervico-thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (CTLSO) introduced in the 1940s\nLess commonly used nowadays due to the convenience of modern braces\nStill used for scoliosis with curves in the high thoracic and cervical spine\nBoston brace\nRisser's cast :\nBody cast that extends up to the cervical spine and touches the chin and sku\nA hole is cut in the abdominal region to make breathing easy\nCharleston bending brace &amp; Providence brace:\nUsed while laying down and sleeping at night for 8 to 10 hours\nBest suited for single thoracolumbar or lumbar curves\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe brace shown in the image is the Milwaukee brace.\nThe Milwaukee brace is an active corrective spinal orthosis primarily used in the ambulatory treatment of structural scoliosis. Designed as a cervico-thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (CTLSO), the main objective of the Milwaukee brace is to delay or eliminate the need for surgery. However, in recent years, the use of the Milwaukee brace has declined due to the availability and convenience of modern braces. Nonetheless, it is still employed for scoliosis cases characterized by high thoracic and cervical spine curves.\n\nOption A: Boston brace is a type of thoraco-lumbo-sacral-orthosis (TLSO brace).

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most common site for spondylolisthesis is L5 - S1 (82%), followed by L4 - L5 (11%).\nSpondylolisthesis is the anterior displacement of one segment of the spine upon another. It is caused as an end result of spondylolysis.\nSpondylolysis refers to defects or stress fractures in the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch. The most common site for spondylolysis is L5.\nThe last stage (stage V) of spondylolisthesis is known as spondyloptosis. There is complete displacement of one vertebra over the next vertebra in this stage.\nNote: Spondylosis is used to describe degenerative findings in the adjacent vertebral endplates due to age-related skeletal changes or osteophyte formation. Spondylitis is inflammation of the vertebrae.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nType III spondylolisthesis is of degenerative origin and presents mostly during middle-age or later. It occurs most commonly at the L4-L5 level.\nWiltse-Newman classification of spondylolisthesis is based on the cause. It is as follows:\nI (Dysplastic) - Congenital abnormalities of the lumbosacral junction\nII (Isthmic or lytic) - Due to defects in the pars interarticularis\nIII (Degenerative) - Degenerative changes in the disc and incompetence of facet joints\nIV (Traumatic) -Posterior arch fractures causing destabilization of the spine\nV (Pathologic) - Due to destructive diseases such as tuberculosis or neoplasm\nVI (Iatrogenic) - After facetectomy surgery and pars fracture during laminectomies\nTypes I and II are commonly seen in childhood and adolescence. These occur most commonly at the L5-S1 level.\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn the above clinical scenario, the history and X-ray are suggestive of spondylolisthesis. The radiological grading of this condition is done using Meyerding classification.\nSpondylolisthesis is graded into 5 types based on the percentage of slippage of one vertebra over the vertebra below.\nThe Meyerding classification of spondylolisthesis is given below.\n\u02dcrade\nDisplacem ent\nI",

A palpable step in the lumbosacral spine is a classic clinical feature of this condition. It is known as step sign.\nNormally, the spinous processes of the adjacent vertebrae are aligned with each other. They can be palpated on the back in a smooth way.\nIn spondylolisthesis, one vertebra has moved over the other. Therefore, a step-off or step sign can be felt over the spinous process at the affected level.\nNote: The step-off sign is also used to describe the radiographic appearance of Lisfranc injury of the foot. There is a dorsal displacement of the tarsal bones with respect to the metatarsal bones.\nSolution to Question 5:\nIn the X-ray given, there is a break in the pars interarticularlis of the L4 vertebra, which appears like a beheaded Scottish terrier. Hence, it is known as beheaded Scottish terrier sign and it is diagnostic of spondylolisthesis.\n\nThe investigation of choice in the case of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis is an oblique view X-ray of the lumbar spine.\nNormally, the posterior elements of the normal vertebra appear like a 'Scottish terrier dog' and this is known as Scottie dog sign.\nThe X-ray spine below shows Scottie dog sign and beheaded Scottish terrier sign.\n\nIn spondylolysis, there is a defect or break in the pars without dislocation. This gives the appearance of Scottish terrier with collar sign as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given AP radiograph of spine depicts the inverted Napolean hat sign, which is seen in stage V of spondylolisthesis.\nIn such cases, there is bilateral spondylolysis and significant spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1. The vertebra appears like an inverted Napolean hat in the AP-view X-ray of the lumbar spine as shown below.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most common cause of sciatica is intervertebral disc prolapse.\nSciatica is defined as a radiating pain along the course of the sciatic nerve. It is felt in the back, buttocks, posterior aspect of the thigh and legs, and the foot.\nCommon causes for sciatica include:\nIntervertebral disc prolapse\nSpondylolisthesis\nSacroiliitis\nHerpes simplex virus\nTuberculoma\nCyst of the sacral nerve root\nDiabetic neuropathy\nSolution to Question 8:\nLumbar disc prolapse most commonly occurs at the level of L4-L5.\nM st common sites of disc prolapse are: L4-L5 &gt; L5-S1 &gt; L3-L4 &gt; L2-L3 &gt; L1-L2.\nAcute disc herniation occurs due to underlying disc degeneration. It is most commonly seen in the fourth to fifth decades of life and is more common in men than in women (3:1 ratio).\nRisk factors include:\nSmoking\nHeavy lifting, especially with torsional stress\nStrenuous physical activity\nOccupational driving\nSome terms related to disc prolapse are:\nProtrusion - posteriorly bulging disc with the outer annulus intact.\nExtrusion - expulsion of fibrocartilaginous disc material after rupture occurs through the posterior longitudinal ligament.\nSequestration - disc material breaks free to lie in the spinal canal.\nSolution to Question 9:\nIn the given scenario the patient most likely has sciatic scoliosis. This refers to the patient tilting to the unaffected side to relieve the pain of intervertebral disc prolapse (IVDP).\nCompensatory scoliosis is seen in those with a short leg or a contracture of the hip. It disappears when the patient is made to sit.\nPostural scoliosis occurs due to incorrect posture being maintained by the patient. It disappears when the patient is made to bend forwards.\nDegenerative scoliosis occurs due to degeneration of the spine with ageing.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe pain of intervertebral disc prolapse decreases in semi-Fowler position. In this position, the patient lies on a bed supine with the head of the bed raised by 30 to 45 degrees.\nCharacteristics of pain in IVDP:\nPain is increased by flexion, sneezing, coughing, straining, and sitting\nPain is decreased by rest and in the semi-Fowler position\nLeg pain equal to or more than the back pain in IVDP cases is evidence of involvement of the nerve root due to herniated disc\nSolution to Question 11:\nDiminished ankle jerk corresponds to S1 nerve root involvement, which is suggestive of disc prolapse between L5-S1.\nWhen there is an L3-L4 prolapse, the L4 nerve root is involved. Pain is felt in the lumbar region and radiates along the anteromedial aspect of the thigh.\nThere is a sensory loss on the posterolateral thigh, anterior knee, medial malleolus, medial foot, and medial shin. There is weakness of the quadriceps muscles leading to reduced to absent knee jerk. This is known as Westphal's sign.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image shows the examiner pressing the popliteal fossa of the patient to elicit sciatic pain. This is known as the Bowstring sign.\nImportant tests for intervertebral disc prolapse:\nStraight Leg Raising Test (SLRT) or Lasegue sign:\nDone to assess nerve root irritation in the lumbosacral area.\nPatient is made to lie on the back with the head extended, with hips and legs in the neutral position.\nAffected leg passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended\nSLRT test negative if leg can be raised 80\u201390 degrees without pain\nSLRT test positive if pain elicited between 30-60 or \u01600 degrees from horizontal\nPain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf\n\nBragard test (sciatic stretch test or flip test):\nPerform SLRT\nWhen the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little till the pain disappears\nAt this angle, the ankle is passively dorsiflexed\nIf pain is felt again at the back of the thigh or in the calf, the test is positive\nAlso called reinforcement positive or Bragard\u2019s sign positive\n\nCrossed SLRT (well-leg raising test or Fajersztajn sign):\nSLRT is performed on the unaffected side\nPain felt on the affected side\nTermed a contralateral positive SLRT or crossed SLRT positive\nVery specific sign of root compression\n\u0161sually positive when there is severe compression due to a centrally located prolapse\nPopliteal compression test or Bowstring sign:\nBowstring sign is more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT\nPerform SLRT until the patient experiences sciatic pain\nWithout reducing the amount of lift, bend the knee to relax the sciatic nerve\nButtock pain is immediately relieved\nThe examiner then presses popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral tibial condyle\nTightening of the nerve like a bowstring re-induces the pain\n\nFemoral stretch (reverse Lasegue test or Mackiewicz sign):\nPatient lies prone\nExaminer flexes the knee and the hip is passively extended\nTest is positive if patient experiences anterior thigh pain\nThis test is usually positive for L2-L3 and L3-L4 (high lumbar) protrusions\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nMRI is the gold standard investigation of the spine for evaluation of a case of low backache.\nMRI spine can help rule out impingement of the spinal cord. It is superior to CT for the identification of infections, tumours, and degenerative changes within the discs.\nOther investigations done for low backache include:\nX-rays have limited value in detecting disc prolapse. They are useful in diagnosing metabolic, degenerative, inflammatory and malignant conditions affecting the spine.\nMyelography is used for demonstrating blocks due to disc prolapse.\nCT scan helps to identify bone and soft tissue problems with greater accuracy.\nSolution to Question 14:\nCauda equina syndrome is the only absolute and urgent indication for surgery in disc prolapse. The relative indications for elective surgery in disc prolapse include:\nFailed conservative management\nProgressive neurological deficit\nRecurrent episodes of incapacitating sciatica\nPain not relieved by complete rest from activities\nThe aim of the surgery is to relieve the pressure on the nerve root. The prolapsed disc is removed\n(discectomy), followed by stabilization of the spine.\nIn most cases of disc prolapse, conservative treatment is given. Conservative therapy for this condition includes:\nBed rest\nHeat\nIce\nAnalgesics\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nAntidepressants\nMuscle relaxants\nEpidural steroids\nSolution to Question 15:\nIn spine fusion surgeries, screws are placed in the pedicle of the vertebrae.\nSpinal fusion or spondylodesis is a surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae. This procedure prevents any movement between the fused vertebrae.\nPedicle screws are placed above and below the vertebrae that are to be fused. These are used in a spinal fusion to add extra support and strength to the fusion while it heals.\nR ds are used to connect the screws as shown below. These prevent movement and allow the bone to heal.\n\nThe post-operative X-ray given below shows fusion of L5 and S1 vertebrae.\n\nInjuries of Pelvis\nQuestion 1:\nWhat are rotationally unstable, but vertically stable pelvic ring fractures classified as?\nTile type B\nTile type C\nNeer type 1\nNeer type 2\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is not included in the criteria of unstable pelvic injury?\nSacroiliac complex disruption more than 1cm\nAvulsion fracture of sacral or ischial end of sacrospinous ligament\nAvulsion fracture of L5 transverse process\nIsolated pubic diastasis of 2 cm\nQuestion 3:\nA patient sustained a fracture as depicted in the image, following a fall from height. What is this fracture known as?\n\nMalgaigne fracture\nChauffeur fracture\nOpen book fracture\nBucket handle fracture\nQuestion 4:\nA young lady who had jumped from the fourth floor of her apartment building was brought to the casualty. CT pelvis revealed jumper's fracture.

He is suspected to have sustained a pelvic fracture. On examination, a closed degloving injury is noted in the proximal part of his right thigh. What is this lesion characteristically known as?\nMalgaigne's lesions\nMorel-Lavallee lesions\nJudet-Letournel lesions\nKocher-Langenback lesions\nQuestion 8:\nA middle aged man complains of left-sided hip pain after he sustained an injury in a game of squash. X-ray pelvis reveals the spur sign. What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?\nPosterior wall acetabular fracture\nAnterior column acetabular fracture\nTransverse acetabular fracture\nBicolumnar acetabular fracture\nQuestion 9:\nAn orthopaedic surgeon uses a posterior approach while operating on a patient with acetabular fracture. What is this approach known as?\nIliofemoral approach\nIlioinguinal approach\nKocher-Langenbeck approach\nStoppa approach\nAnswer Key\nQuestion No.\nCorrect Option",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nRotationally unstable, but vertically stable pelvic ring fractures are classified as Tile type B. Two classification systems are used in the evaluation of pelvic ring fractures:\nThe Tile classification provides an assessment of the stability of the pelvis. It helps the surgeon predict the need for surgery. Pelvic ring fractures are classified into 3 types:\nThe Young and Burgess classification is based on the mechanism of injury. It helps the surgeon predict the severity of the injury, blood loss, and deformity or displacement.\nNote: Neer classification is used for proximal humerus fractures.\nTile classification\nStability\nManagement\nType A\nRotationally and verticallysta ble\nConservative\nType B\nRotationally unstable and ver tically stable\nExternal fixation is used for definitive management. Ante rior fixation is additionally d one if pubic bones have separ ated by more than 2.5 cm.\nType C\nRotationally and verticallyun stable\nPosterior fixation is done for vertical stability along with e xternal fixation.\nSolution to Question 2:\nIsolated pubic diastasis is not a criterion for unstable pelvic injury. For the pubic diastasis to be considered unstable, it must be accompanied with posterior ring injury or injury of sacro-tuberous or sacro-spinous ligaments.\nRadiographic factors indicating unstable pelvic injury include:\nSacroiliac joint disruption &gt;1 cm.\nGap in posterior pelvic ring.\nAvulsion fracture of L5 transverse process or sacrotuberous or sacrospinous ligament.\nPubic diastasis of &gt; 2 cm along with posterior ring injury or sacro-tuberous ligament or sacrospinous ligament.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe fracture shown in the image is known as Malgaigne's fracture.\nThis fracture involves the pubic rami anteriorly and the sacroiliac joint (SI joint) or ilium near the SI joint on the same side posteriorly.\nChauffeur's fracture refers to fracture of the radial styloid process in the forearm.\nOpen book fracture are associated with pubic diastasis and/or a fracture of the pubic rami with a posterior pelvic disruption of the sacro-iliac joint.\n\nBucket handle fracture refers to a vertically orientated fracture through ipsilateral superior and inferior pubic rami with contralateral sacroiliac joint disruption.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nJumper\u2019s fracture is H or U-shaped fracture of the sacrum.\nThese are called jumper's or suicide jumper's fracture as they are seen in falls from height. There are two longitudinal fractures that run through the sacral foramina and a transverse fracture. The level of the transverse fracture line determines if it is H or U shaped.\nAs these fractures pass through the sacral foramina, they can cause injury to the spinal cord and result in cauda equina syndrome.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nBilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fracture is called straddle fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nAcute haemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock is the most common complication of pelvic fractures.\nIn fractures of the pelvic ring, there is a risk of injury to the major vessels (internal iliac and external iliac vessels) and to the venous plexus around the sacroiliac joint. Bleeding from the venous plexus is the major cause of pelvic haemorrhage.\nPotential blood loss in fractures is given below:\nPelvic fractures have a high mortality rate ranging from 10% to 50% in some open pelvic fractures. Early mortality is mostly the result of haemorrhage. Late mortality occurs from sepsis or multiple system organ failure.\nFracture site\nPotential blood loss\nPelvis\n> 2 litres\nFemur",

    "question_text": "5 - 1.5 litres\nSolution to Question 7:\nClosed degloving soft tissue injuries associated with pelvic and acetabular fractures are known as Morel-Lavallee lesions.\nMorel-Lavallee lesion involves separation of skin from the underlying fascia. They are frequently seen in pelvic fractures due to motor vehicle accidents and other crush injuries. The shearing force in these injuries creates a pocket between skin and fascia where a considerable amount of blood can collect.\nMRI and ultrasonography are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\nComplications of Morel-Lavallee lesions include infection, subcutaneous fat necrosis, and necrosis of the overlying skin. These lesions are managed through incisional drainage, debridement, and irrigation of the wound.\nSolution to Question 8:\nSpur sign is seen in bicolumnar acetabular fractures.\nBicolumnar fractures cause disruption of both the anterior and posterior columns on the acetabulum. Due to the fracture in the acetabulum, the femoral head migrates medially. The unsupported triangular area of the ilium is then seen laterally as the spur sign. It is best seen on obturator oblique view radiographs.\nThe obturator oblique X-ray image of pelvis shows a comminuted left acetabular fracture affecting both the columns (disruption of both the iliopectineal and ilioischial lines). The left ilium is seen pointing laterally (spur sign).\n\nPosterior wall fractures are the most common type of acetabular fractures. Letournel and Judet classification is used to classify acetabular fractures.\nJudet view (45-degree oblique) and AP views are used to radiographically evaluate acetabular fractures.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe posterior approach used in acetabular fractures is known as the Kocher-Langenbeck approach.\nThe surgical approaches used in the management of acetabular fractures include:\nKocher-Langenbeck approach is the posterior approach that provides access to the posterior wall, posterior column, and to transverse fractures. It is also used for handling sciatic nerve injuries.\nThe ilioinguinal approach provides access to the entire anterior column, symphysis pubis, ilium, and sacroiliac joint. The Stoppa approach is a modification of the ilioinguinal approach.\nThe iliofemoral approach is a lateral approach that is rarely used nowadays due to the high rate of complication.\nInfections of the bone\nQuestion 1:\nWhich is the earliest site of infection in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis?\nEpiphysis\nDiaphysis\nMetaphysis\nPeriosteum\nQuestion 2:\nA 4-year old girl is brought with high-grade fever, malaise, and severe pain over her left knee. Examination reveals tenderness over the medial aspect of the left knee joint. What is the most likely cause of this condition?\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nHaemophilus influenzae\nStaphylococcus aureus\nStreptococcus pyogenes\nQuestion 3:\nWhich of the following patients with acute osteomyelitis is most likely to develop limb shortening and deformity?\nA 36-year-old HIV positive woman not on treatment\nA 68-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension\nA 1-year-old male infant who is otherwise healthy\nA 6-year-old girl with a history of sickle cell disease\nQuestion 4:\nA 6-year-old boy was referred for fever and chills for 2 days. His mother says that he has been refusing to walk and screams when his left leg is touched. Examination revealed point\ntenderness over the medial tibia. Investigations revealed the following.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe earliest site of infection in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is the metaphysis. It is also the most common site of infection.\nThe infection reaches metaphysis via the hematogenous route. The metaphysis is susceptible due to the following factors:\nHairpin loop arrangement of terminal blood vessels - leads to vascular stasis that favors bacterial colonization\nFewer phagocytes in this area\nApart from the hematogenous route, acute osteomyelitis can also occur by the exogenous route. This includes open fractures, iatrogenic intervention, or spread from local infection.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute osteomyelitis. The most common organism causing osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus.\nThe other common causative organisms include:\nPseudomonas aeruginosa - most common cause in IV drug abusers\nSalmonella - patients with sickle cell anemia are prone\nHaemophilus influenzae - was a common causative organism in children, less common now due to vaccination\nStreptococcus pyogenes\nEscherichia coli\nIt presents with acute onset fever, pain, and tenderness of the affected site. Redness, warmth, swelling, and edema are late features. It most commonly involves the proximal tibia or proximal and distal ends of the femur.\nIt commonly occurs by hematogenous spread following toe infections, ear discharge, tooth infection, sore throat, or a boil. In infants, the source of infection may be umbilical cord infection, heel prick, or IV cannula.\nSolution to Question 3:\nAcute osteomyelitis is most likely to cause limb shortening and deformity in infants because of the involvement of the growth plate, epiphysis, and the adjacent joint.\nThis occurs because the metaphyseal infection spreads via the blood vessels of the physis (growth plate) to the epiphysis and the adjacent joint. Hence, septic arthritis is frequently associated with acute osteomyelitis in infancy. The resulting damage to the growth plate and septic arthritis of the adjacent joint lead to limb shortening and deformity.\nBeyond 2 years of age, the physis acts as a barrier preventing the direct spread of metaphyseal infection into the epiphysis. Hence, the metaphyseal infection more commonly spreads to the diaphysis.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute osteomyelitis. Vacuum-assisted closure is not used in the management of acute osteomyelitis. It is used in the management of chronic osteomyelitis following extensive debridement.\nManagement of acute osteomyelitis includes the following:\nImmediate empirical antibiotic therapy (after taking blood samples for culture and sensitivity)\nSurgical drainage - if patient does not respond to antibiotics or if abscess is detected on imaging\nSupportive therapy - analgesics, IV fluids, and splinting of the limb The complications of inadequately treated acute osteomyelitis include:\nSepticemia\nChronic osteomyelitis\nSeptic arthritis\nAltered bone growth\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe first bony lesion of osteomyelitis is seen on an x-ray during the 2nd week of infection. It is due to periosteal new bone formation and appears as a faint extracortical outline.\nWhen osteomyelitis is suspected on clinical grounds, early x-rays show only soft tissue swelling with no bony abnormality. Hence, the following imaging modalities are highly sensitive and are used to aid the diagnosis within 24-48 hours:\nMRI - shows marrow edema within 24-48 hours\nTechnetium-99 bone scan - shows increased osseous uptake of the trace\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn the given radiographs showing features of chronic osteomyelitis, the marked structures are as follows:\nInvolucrum is the thick sheath of periosteal new bone that surrounds the sequestrum.\nCloacae are openings in the involucrum that allow drainage of purulent and necrotic material out of the dead bone.\nSequestrum is a piece of devitalized bone that has been separated from its surrounding bone during the process of necrosis.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario of a patient with a history of an accident 2 years ago, experiencing symptoms of pain and swelling at the site of injury, and an X-ray of the lower limb revealing sequestrum and involucrum in the tibia, strongly suggests a diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.\n\nChronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma (like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to alternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis.\nSequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the healthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a nidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. Sinus tracts are formed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.\nThe involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from deep layers of stripped periosteum. Cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tiny spicules of bone may be discharged through them.\nThe radiograph below shows sequestrum, involucrum and cloacae:\n\nOption A: Osteogenic sarcoma characteristically shows the sun-burst appearance and Codman's triangle, as shown below.\n\nOption B: Ewing's sarcoma shows an onion-skin appearance of the periosteum, as shown below.\n\nOption D: Multiple myeloma shows multiple punched-out lesions of the bone, as shown below.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThis clinical scenario and image showing a sinus are suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis. In this condition, sequestrum acts as the nidus of infection and is the most common cause of non-healing and recurrence.\nSequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the healthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a nidus for infection. It leads to persistent pus discharge and abscess in the bone. Sinus tracts are formed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.\nThe involucrum is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from deep layers of stripped periosteum. Cloacae are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tiny spicules of bone may be discharged through them.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nPaprika sign in chronic osteomyelitis is seen during the curettage of the bone. It refers to active punctate bleeding on debridement and indicates a healthy tissue surface.\nThe appearance of the paprika sign is an indication that the curettage is adequate. Effective curettage is very important as inadequate debridement is one of the reasons for high recurrence rates in chronic osteomyelitis.\nMRI in chronic osteomyelitis shows rim sign which is a rim of high signal intensity surrounding the focus of disease.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe bony defect left behind after debridement is called dead space. Metal plates are not used in its management as they act as a nidus of infection and cause recurrent disease. If metal implants are already in place, they must be replaced by external fixators.\nThe dead space created after debridement in chronic osteomyelitis leads to bony instability. It is managed using the following techniques:\nPMMA beads (polymethyl methacrylate) impregnated with antibiotics - in initial stages\nCancellous bone graft - later stages\nMuscle flap transfe\nSolution to Question 11:\nBrodie's abscess is not a complication of chronic osteomyelitis. It is a subacute variant of osteomyelitis.\nThe complications of chronic osteomyelitis include:\nPathological fracture - most common, occurs due to devitalization of the bone and sequestrum formation\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) - occurs rarely due to metaplasia in a chronic discharging sinus\nAmyloidosis - occurs rarely due to long-standing inflammation\nSolution to Question 12:\nSclerosing osteomyelitis of Garre is characterized by the absence of pus.\nIt is a specific type of chronic osteomyelitis and is caused by a low-grade anaerobic infection that is effectively contained by the host immune system. Hence, there is no abscess or sequestrum formation.\nThis condition is characterized by an excessive periosteal reaction at the affected site of the bone, causing marked sclerosis and cortical thickening.\nThe given radiograph shows Garre's osteomyelitis:\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is the most common cause of septic arthritis in sexually active young adults.\nStaphylococcus aureus causes septic arthritis in all ages followed by group A Streptococcus and Enterobacter.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given clinical scenario is highly suggestive of septic arthritis. The next best step is the aspiration of the joint fluid to confirm the diagnosis and identify the organism.\nEmpirical antibiotic therapy has to be started immediately after aspiration. It is not the first step as giving antibiotics would interfere with the identification of infective organisms from the aspirated fluid. Blood culture is positive only in a few cases and has very little diagnostic value.\nUSG is the most reliable investigation to detect effusion at an early stage. MRI is reserved for infections in obscure sites like the sacroiliac or sternoclavicular joints.\nSolution to Question 15:\nSeptic arthritis needs to be treated immediately to prevent the destruction of articular cartilage.\nWhen the synovium becomes infected, there is an acute inflammatory response and effusion into the joint space. Destruction of articular cartilage begins within 2 days of infection and becomes apparent in 4-6 days.\nThere is depletion of ground substance and destruction of collagen due to exposure to collagenases. This is brought about by enzymes of the inflammatory response, bacterial toxins, and stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This destruction of articular cartilage finally progresses to bony ankylosis.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThis clinical scenario is suggestive of septic arthritis of the hip joint in an infant. This condition is also called Tom Smith arthritis.\nSeptic arthritis of the hip in infancy causes severe destruction of the femoral head as it is cartilaginous at this age. This results in limb shortening and increased mobility at the hip joint leading to an unstable gait.\nThe following image shows destruction and deformation of the left femoral head in a child who had suffered from septic arthritis in infancy.\n\nOptions A and C: Holstein-Lewis and Tillaux-Chaput are types of fractures.\nOption B: The Hawkin-Kennedy test is used to diagnose supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor injury as a result of impingement between coracohumeral ligament and the greater tubercule of the humerus.\nSolution to Question 17:\nIn patients with transient synovitis of the hip, the attitude of the affected limb is flexion, abduction, and external rotation.\nThis attitude maximizes the capsular volume of the hip joint and, thus, minimizes the intracapsular pressure. This leads to a decrease in pain caused by joint effusion.\nTransient synovitis\nSeptic arthritis\nReactive inflammation follow ing a viral infection\nSuppurative infection of the j oint\nCommon in children\nMay occur in all age groups, especially with comorbidities (rheumatoid arthritis, immun osuppression)\nPainful, but with preserved w eight bearing\nInability to bear weight on th e affected side\nNormal WBC count and ESR\nHigh WBC count and ESR\nSelf-limiting conditionAnalge sics and bed rest\nRequires IV antibiotics and s urgical drainage\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given clinical scenario and image showing flexed positioning of the affected finger are descriptive of Kanavel's sign. It is characteristically positive in infectious flexor tenosynovitis.\nThis sign has four cardinal components:\nTenderness over the flexor sheath\nRigid positioning of the finger in flexion\nPain on attempts to hyperextend the fingers\nSwelling of the involved part\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe given clinical scenario of a child with prolonged swelling and pain over the upper tibia, along with a radiograph showing a lytic lesion with a dense sclerotic rim and minimal periosteal reaction, suggests the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess.\nBrodie's abscess is a localized form of subacute osteomyelitis that occurs when organisms of low virulence infect an immunocompetent host. The abscess is walled off by the thickening of the surrounding bone trabeculae. It most commonly involves the metaphysis of the proximal tibia and distal femur.\nThe patient is typically a child or adolescent experiencing prolonged pain near a large joint for several weeks or months. Symptoms may include a limp, slight swelling, muscle wasting, and localized tenderness.\nThe typical radiographic finding is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent cavity measuring",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nSkeletal tuberculosis most commonly affects the dorso-lumbar (thoraco-lumbar) spine in adults (thoracic &gt; lumbar).\nThe cervical spine is most commonly affected in children.\nSkeletal TB affects the axial skeleton more than the appendicular skeleton. Hence, spinal TB is more common as compared to TB of the joints. In the appendicular skeleton, the hip and knee joints are more commonly affected.\nSolution to Question 2:\nIn cases of spinal tuberculosis, the paradiscal area (marked '2' in the image) of the vertebra is most commonly involved.\nThe probable reason for this is the rich blood supply of this area which favors the high oxygen requirement of the tuberculosis bacilli. Appendiceal/ posterior vertebral involvement is the least commonly seen in skeletal TB.\nThe structures marked in the image are as shown below:\n- Posterior spinal elements\n- Paradiscal area of the vertebra\n- Anterior vertebral body\n- Central vertebral body\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nSpinal tuberculosis leads to loss of lumbar lordosis.\nSpinal TB more often causes compression fracture of the anterior part of the vertebrae. This leads to anterior wedging of the vertebrae giving rise to kyphosis.\nWhen spinal TB involves the thoracic vertebrae, it exaggerates the existing thoracic kyphosis. Clinical features of spinal tuberculosis:\nBack pain and stiffness are the usual early complaints\nCautious gait - a person with spinal TB will walk carefully with short steps to avoid pain resulting from movement\nDecreased flexion and extension - all the movements of the vertebral column are decreased in spinal TB due to the associated paraspinal muscle spasm, pain, and skeletal deformity\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe skeletal deformity shown above is gibbus. It involves the collapse of two or three vertebral levels and presents as sharp posterior angulation.\nSpinal tuberculosis may present with the following skeletal deformities:\nDeformity\nMechanism\nDescription\nKnuckle\nCollapse of a single vertebra\nProminence of a single spino us process\nGibbus/Kyphus\nCollapse of 2-3 vertebral level s\nSharp posterior angulation\nKyphosis\nCollapse of anterior vertebral bodies\nExaggerated curvature of the vertebral column\nDeformity\nMechanism\nDescription\nConcertina collapse / vertebr a plana\nCollapse of the entire vertebr al body\nSeen in tuberculosis of the ce ntral vertebral body\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe reduction of disc space between the vertebrae is an early radiographic finding in spinal tuberculosis. This indicates the destruction of the intervertebral disc due to spinal tuberculosis.\nThe infection first involves the vertebral bodies and the intervertebral disc. Hence, the early radiographic features include rarefaction/osteopenic appearance of the involved vertebrae and reduction of disc space between the vertebrae.\nIn later stages, the infection leads to para-vertebral abscess formation and vertebral destruction. These features can be seen on a radiograph as bird\u2019s nest abscess and anterior wedging of vertebrae respectively.\nWhen the disease is in the healing phase, the sclerotic appearance of vertebrae can be seen.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of late-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis. It is because of vertebral collapse which causes injury to the spinal cord.\nSpinal tuberculosis with neurological involvement is known as Pott\u2019s paraplegia. It is classified as early-onset and late-onset paraplegia:\nEarly-onset paraplegia occurs within 2 years of disease onset. It is due to edema, abscess, or granulation tissue that causes spinal cord compression\nLate-onset paraplegia in spinal tuberculosis is because of vertebral collapse which causes injury to the spinal cord.\nPrognosis is better in early-onset paresis because it can subside when the active infection is treated or when the drainage of the abscess relieves compression of the cord.\nSolution to Question 7:\nFlaccid paralysis is seen in the final stage of Pott\u2019s paraplegia.\nPott's paraplegia begins as a UMN lesion. So initially, the patient is asymptomatic but ankle clonus, increased deep tendon reflexes, and extensor plantar can be detected on clinical examination.\nIt then progresses to spastic paraplegia of the extensors and the flexors. In later stages, it presents as an LMN lesion causing flaccid paralysis.\nSolution to Question 8:\nLaminectomy is indicated when the posterior parts of the vertebrae are involved.\nManagement of Pott\u2019s paraplegia includes conservative management (with antitubercular therapy) or surgery.\nThe \"middle path regimen\" combines both the approaches and includes the following:\nAntitubercular therapy\nImmobilization using spinal braces\nDraining of abscess/surgery if required Surgery is indicated in the following conditions:\nFailed conservative management\nRecurrence of the disease after treatment\nRapid onset paraplegia\nBladder and bowel involvement Surgeries for Pott\u2019s paraplegia include:\nAntero-lateral decompression - it helps in the removal of both solid and liquid debris and so it's the surgery of choice for Pott\u2019s paraplegia\nCostotransversectomy - surgery indicated for paravertebral abscess\nLaminectomy - indicated when the posterior parts of vertebrae are involved\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe lamina process of the vertebra is not removed in anterolateral decompression surgery. Anterolateral decompression surgery is the preferred surgery for Pott\u2019s paraplegia.\nThe structures removed in this procedure are :\nPosterior part of the rib\nTransverse process\nPedicle\nPart of the vertebral body anterior to the spinal cord\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of tuberculosis of the hip. An apparent shortening of the limb is seen in the stage of early arthritis.\nClinical features seen in the four stages of TB hip:\nStage of synovitis presents with apparent lengthening of the limb due to abduction deformity.\nStage of early arthritis presents with apparent shortening of the limb due to adduction deformity.\nStage of advanced arthritis leads to true shortening of the limb because of the destruction of the articular cartilage of the femur and the acetabulum.\nStage of arthritis with subluxation leads to true shortening of the limb. The destruction of acetabulum leads to dislocation of the femur head. This is also known as wandering acetabulum/ mortar and pestle hip because of the widened acetabulum and diminished size of femur head.\nThe TB of the hip finally results in fibrous ankylosis of the hip joint.\nNote: The apparent length of the lower limb is measured from the umbilicus to the medial malleolus and the true length of the limb is measured from the anterior superior iliac spine to the\nmedial malleolus. The apparent length is increased when there is abduction deformity of the hip and decreased when there is adduction deformity of the hip.\nSolution to Question 11:\nGirdlestone arthroplasty preserves the mobility of the hip joint It is done for the management of TB of hip.\nEarly stages of TB hip can be conservatively managed by antitubercular therapy, traction, and immobilization. Later stages need surgical management.\nSurgeries for TB hip include:\nSynovectomy and joint debridement is the preferred surgery in early arthritis.\nGirdlestone arthroplasty refers to the modification of the articular surface of the joint. It involves excision of the affected portion of the joint and reconstruction of the joint with vastus lateralis muscle. It gives a painless, mobile joint but it results in an unstable hip.\nArthrodesis refers to the fusion of the joint. It is indicated in painful fibrous ankylosis. It gives a painless stable hip joint.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of the triple deformity characteristically seen in TB knee. It occurs due to the spasm of biceps femoris.\nTuberculosis of the knee presents with triple deformity, which includes:\nPosterior (and lateral) subluxation - due to ligament laxity/ degeneration\nExternal/lateral rotation - due to spasm of biceps femoris\nFlexion - due to spasm of the hamstrings (semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps femoris)\nSartorius, gracilis, and popliteus are responsible for medial rotation at the knee joint and do not contribute to triple deformity.\nSolution to Question 13:\nSpina ventosa is a feature of tuberculous dactylitis. This refers to the tuberculosis of short tubular bones i.e. metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.\nThe infection is lodged in the marrow cavity leading to spindle-shaped expansion/ ballooned-out appearance of the bone known as spina ventosa. Periosteal reaction, abscess, and sinus formation are seen.\nTB sicca or caries sicca is the tuberculosis of the shoulder joint. It usually does not have any effusion of joint, hence it is known as sicca which is a Latin word for 'dry'.\nThe image below shows tuberculous dactylitis. Note the swelling in the affected phalanx.\n\nFractures in children\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the most common bone to be fractured in children?\nDistal forearm bones\nHumerus\nClavicle\nCarpals\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is false about supracondylar fracture of the humerus?\nIt is the most common pediatric elbow fracture\nFlexion type is the most common\nThe Gartland classification is commonly used\nAnterior interosseous nerve is most commonly injured\nQuestion 3:\nA 4-year-old girl was brought to the emergency following a fall in the playground. On examination, her right arm was swollen, pink, and pulseless. An x-ray revealed a supracondylar fracture of the right humerus. What is the most appropriate management?\nObservation\nReduction and pinning\nFasciotomy\nVascular repair\nQuestion 4:\nHow would you classify the following injury?\n\nSalter-Harris type III\nSalter-Harris type II\nSalter-Harris type V\nSalter-Harris type IV\nQuestion 5:\nA 13-year-old boy is brought to the ED two hours after falling from his bicycle. He complains f progressive pain and swelling in his left arm. On examination, the pointing index sign is noted.

On examination, varying degrees of ecchymosis are noted over the buttocks and upper limbs.\nray reveals a metaphyseal corner fracture of the right femur. What is the likely diagnosis?\nAlbers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease\nBattered baby syndrome\nVitamin D deficiency\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nQuestion 9:\nA toddler was brought to the pediatrician with forearm swelling and inconsolable crying. An x-ray revealed the following. What is your diagnosis?\n\nTorus fracture\nNightstick fracture\nMonteggia fracture\nGreenstick fracture\nQuestion 10:\nIn patients with Madelung deformity, which of the following bones is involved?\nDistal ulna\nDistal radius\nTrapezoid\nTriquetrum\nQuestion 11:\nA 7-year-old boy is being evaluated for the following deformity of his left elbow. 3 years ago, he had suffered a fracture of his left elbow following a fall on his outstretched hand.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most common bones to be fractured in children are the distal forearm bones.\nThe distal radius is the most commonly fractured bone in childhood. It is more commonly fractured than the clavicle.\nThe clavicle is most commonly fractured during birth.\nSolution to Question 2:\nMost supracondylar fractures (98%) are extension-type injuries. They are usually caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand.\nSupracondylar humeral fractures are the most common type of pediatric elbow fracture. They most commonly lead to the following nerve injuries:\nExtension-type: Anterior interosseous nerve\nFlexion-type: Ulnar nerve\nAccording to the Gartland classification, there are 3 types of fractures:\nType I: Undisplaced\nType II: Some degree of displacement\nType III: Complete displacement\nThe following x-ray shows a type III supracondylar fracture of the humerus:\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThis clinical scenario with a pink and pulseless arm is suggestive of a supracondylar fracture with adequate perfusion. The treatment of choice is reduction and pinning, followed by observation.\nOn the other hand, if there is poor perfusion due to vascular compromise, the affected arm is pale and cool to the touch. In this case, the urgent reduction must be performed in the operating room. After reduction, the vascular status of the hand is reassessed. If the hand remains pale, exploration of the brachial artery, the release of entrapped structures, and direct repair with vein grafting may be required.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe physeal injury depicted in the given diagram is classified as Salter-Harris type II.\nIn a type II fracture, the fracture line passes through the metaphysis into the epiphyseal plate. This results in a metaphyseal fragment called the Thurston-Holland fragment. The epiphysis is spared.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe pointing index sign is seen in supracondylar fractures of the humerus.\nThis finding occurs as a result of injury to the median nerve. It results in loss of function of both flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Hence, the index finger sticks out when the patient is asked to clasp their hand.\nThe image shows the pointing index sign:\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe capitellum is the first ossification center to appear around the elbow.\nThe order of appearance of ossification centers can be remembered using the mnemonic CRITOE:\nCapitellum: 2 years\nRadial head: 4 years\nInternal epicondyle:6 years\nTrochlea: 8 years\nOlecranon: 10 years\nExternal (lateral) epicondyle: 12 years\nSolution to Question 7:\nLong bone fractures, particularly spiral fractures, in non-ambulatory infants &lt; 1 year should raise the suspicion of child abuse.\nAccidental fractures of long bones (humerus, tibia, radius) are common in toddlers and older children once they start walking.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThis clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome.\nNon-accidental trauma must be suspected when there are ecchymoses and fractures in various stages of healing. This indicates that the trauma has occurred over a period of time. Metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures are typically seen on x-ray. Sub-epiphyseal micro-fracture is also a feature of child abuse that is seen on MRI.\nIn such cases, a radiological assessment of the entire skeleton is indicated. The minimum x-ray views required in a case of suspected child abuse are:\nAP views of the entire skeleton\nDedicated views of hands and feet\nLateral views of the axial and appendicular skeleton\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given image shows a fracture with a broken cortex on one side and an intact cortex on the other side. This is called a greenstick fracture and is common in children.\nOption A: Torus fracture or buckle fracture occurs due to buckling of the cortex. It most commonly occurs at the transition between metaphysis and diaphysis.\n\n\nOption B: Nightstick fracture refers to a fracture of the shaft of the ulna.\nOption C: Monteggia fracture refers to a fracture of the proximal ulna with an associated radial head dislocation.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe distal radius is involved in Madelung deformity.\nThis is a congenital or post-traumatic deformity in children due to disruption of the ulnar and volar aspect of the growth plate of the distal radius. This disruption is believed to be caused by the Vicker's ligament. This ligament normally tethers the lunate to the distal radius proximal to the physis.\n\nDisruption of the growth plate causes a ventral curvature of the distal radius. However, the ulna continues to grow and the distal ulna appears more prominent may stick out as a lump on the back of the wrist. This is known as a positive ulnar variance. There is volar subluxation of the hand.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe image shows the cubitus valgus deformity of the left elbow, which is usually a complication of lateral condyle fracture of the humerus. It can be corrected by medial closed wedge osteotomy or lateral open wedge osteotomy.\nCubitus varus can be corrected by a lateral closed wedge osteotomy or medial open wedge osteotomy.\nDerotation osteotomies are commonly used for the correction of lower limb deformities.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe x-ray shows a fracture at the junction of the middle and distal 1/3 of both radius and ulna. The elbow should be flexed at 90\u00b0 and the forearm should be in mid-pronation position while applying the cast.\nForearm fractures in children are managed conservatively by applying a POP cast. In adults, surgery is preferred (open reduction and internal fixation).\nFracture site on the forearm\nPosition of forearm(with elbo w flexed)\nUpper one-third\nFull supination\nMiddle one-third\nMid pronation (neutral)\nLower one-third fracture\nFull pronation\nCTEV, Genu varum and valgum\nQuestion 1:\nA 3-month-old infant was brought to the clinic with the given malformation present since birth. What is the primary deformity in this condition?\n\nConvex lateral border\nAbduction\nConcave medial border\nAdduction\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following tests can be performed in a child with CTEV to detect tibial torsion?\nDorsiflexion test\nOrtolani's test\nPlumb line test\nBarlow's test\nQuestion 3:\nWhich angle is depicted in the radiograph below?\n\nGissane angle\nMeary's angle\nBohler's angle\nKite\u2019s angle\nQuestion 4:\nWhat is the right order of correction of deformities in an infant with CTEV?\nCavus, adduction, varus, equinus\nValgus, abduction, equinus, cavus\nCavus, abduction, varus, equinus\nCavus, adduction, valgus, equinus\nQuestion 5:\nA pediatrician referred a newborn with the given deformity to the orthopedics department. Ponseti's method was planned for correction. Which of the following is incorrect regarding this technique?\n\nEquinus is corrected last\nBelow knee cast is applie\nHead of the talus acts as the fulcrum\nTreatment should be started within first 2 weeks of life\nQuestion 6:\nA 1-year-old boy was undergoing treatment for CTEV with a POP cast for the past 6 months. However, his deformities have not improved. What is the next best step in management?\nCTEV shoes\nDillwyn Evans procedure\nTurco's procedure\nTriple arthrodesis\nQuestion 7:\nAn infant undergoing treatment for CTEV has just started walking. Which of the following is false regarding the shoes that he will be prescribed to wear?\nThe straight inner border prevents cavus\nOuter shoe raise prevents foot inversion\nAbsence of heel prevents equinus\nThese shoes can be used until 5 years\nQuestion 8:\nA 12-year-old with neglected CTEV and muscle wasting is brought to the hospital. A triple arthrodesis is planned. Which of the following joints will not be fused?\nTalocrural\nCalcaneocuboi\nTalonavicular\nTalocalcaneal\nQuestion 9:\nWhich of the following methods can be used for external fixation in a patient with resistant CTEV?\nDwyer's procedure\nDavis procedure\nJoshi's metho\nDillwyn Evan's procedure\nQuestion 10:\nA child was brought to the orthopaedic OPD for evaluation of the given knee deformity. What is it known as?\n\nGenu recurvatum\nGenu varus\nGenu valgum\nWindswept deformity\nQuestion 11:\nA 7-year-old boy fractured the lateral condyle of his femur. He developed malunion as a complication.

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nAdduction of the forefoot is a primary deformity in congenital talipes equinus varus (CTEV).\nThe five primary deformities in CTEV are:\nCavus- excessive arching of the foot\nAdduction of forefoot\nVarus- inversion and adduction of foot\nEquinus- increased plantar flexion\nInternal tibial torsion- medial rotation of the tibia\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe plumb line test helps to detect tibial torsion which is seen in congenital talipes equinus varus\n(CTEV).\nThe child is made to sit at a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line is drawn from the center of the patella to the tibial tubercle. This is called the plumb line.\nNormally, when extended down, it should cut the foot at the first or second inter-metatarsal space.\nIn CTEV, due to medial rotation of the tibia plumb line cuts the third or fourth inter-metatarsal space.\n\nOption A: A dorsiflexion test is done in the screening of clubfoot. In a newborn, the dorsum of the foot can be brought in contact with the tibia by dorsiflexion but not in CTEV.\nOptions B and D: Ortolani's and Barlow's tests are performed in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given radiograph shows Kite\u2019s angle, which is the angle between the long axis of the talus and the long axis of the calcaneum.\nThe normal Kite's angle is 30-55 degrees. In CTEV, the Kite's angle is less than 25 degrees.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe right order of correction of CTEV is cavus followed by adduction, then varus, and lastly equinus (CAVE).\nAn incorrect sequence of correction or overtreatment of CTEV can result in the development of the rocker-bottom foot. It is characterized by a prominent heel and a convex sole.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nIn Ponseti's method, an above-knee cast is used to correct clubfoot.\nPonseti's method is the currently used method for conservative management of CTEV. Previously Kite's method was followed.\nPonseti's method\nKite's method\nTreatment start\n<2 weeks",

    "question_text": "9 months\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe next best step, in this case, is posteromedial soft tissue release (PMSTR), also known as Turco's procedure.\nBy 1 year of age, posteromedial soft tissue gets contracted. This causes difficulty in the manipulation of the joint. Therefore, PMSTR is done and tight soft tissue structures (tendons, ligaments, capsule) on the posterior and medial side of the foot are cut.\nSolution to Question 7:\nWhen the child starts walking, CTEV shoes are prescribed for the daytime. The straight inner border in CTEV shoes prevents adduction, not cavus.\nCTEV shoes are prescribed when the child starts walking and are used up to 5 years of age. The straight inner border prevents adduction, while the absence of heel prevents the equinus. An outer shoe raise is present to prevent foot inversion.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe talocrural joint (ankle joint) is not involved in triple arthrodesis.\nTriple arthrodesis involves the fusion of talonavicular, talocalcaneal and calcaneocuboid joints.\nTriple arthrodesis is done for recurrent or persistent clubfoot deformity in older children (chronic cases). It is done after 10-12 years of age as before this age bones are not fully ossified, therefore fusion may not be adequate. Inadequate fusion is known as pseudoarthrosis.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nJoshi's method (Joshi's external stabilisation system - JESS) is a method of external fixation used in CTEV.\nTreatment by external fixators is a recent concept in the management of CTEV. It is done for difficult cases.\nThere are two types of external fixator frames:\nIlizarov's\nJoshi's (JESS)\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe deformity shown is genu valgum.\nA normal knee has 5-7 degrees physiological outward deviation (valgum). Any increase or decrease in angle can result in knee deformities.\nKnee deformities are:\nGenu valgus (valgum) or knock knee - Knees are abnormally approximated and the ankles are ivergent.\nGenu varus (varum) or bow knee - Knees are abnormally divergent and the ankles are approximated.\nWindswept deformity - Abnormal valgus deformity of one knee with varus of the other.\nGenu recurvatum - Hyperextension at the knee joint with backwards bending.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe boy is most likely to develop genu valgus subsequent to lateral condyle fracture of the femur.\nFracture of lateral condyle femur will result in injury to the lateral growth plate of the femur, and thus only the medial condyle will continue to grow with age resulting in genu valgus.\nSimilarly, injury to the medial growth plate of the femur will cause the lateral condyle to grow only with age, resulting in genu varus.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe most common cause of acquired genu recurvatum is poliomyelitis. Causes of genu recurvatum:\nCongenital (due to abnormal intrauterine position)\nAcquire\nNeurological disorders like polio, cerebral palsy\nRickets\nMalunion\nKnee fractures\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nGenu varus is a feature of Blount's disease.\nBlount's disease, is a growth disorder of proximal tibial physis that causes the lower leg to angle inwards resulting in genu varus.\nTriad seen in Blount's disease:\nBilateral idiopathic genu varus\nGenu recurvatum\nInternal rotation of tibia\nCongenital malformations, Perthes disease and SCFE\nQuestion 1:\nThe radiograph of an infant with a hip deformity is given below. There is no history of trauma. Which of the following is not a risk factor for developing this condition?\n\nPositive family history\nBreech presentation\nMale gender\nFirst born child\nQuestion 2:\nWhat is the vertical line drawn at the outer border of the acetabulum called as?\nHilgenreiner's line\nPerkin's line\nShenton's line\nKlein's line\nQuestion 3:\nA 3-month-old baby is brought to the OPD by her mother as she noticed some deformity in the hip and lower limbs of the child. On examination, asymmetry of groin crease is seen and the following test in the image is positive. What is the name of the test being performed?\n\nBarlow's test\nOrtolani's test\nGaleazzi's test\nDurkan's test\nQuestion 4:\nWhich of the following is unlikely to be seen in patients with DDH?\nAltered gait\nLimb shortenin\nDecreased lumbar lordosis\nDecreased abduction\nQuestion 5:\nA mother with a history of breech delivery brings her 1-month-old baby to the OPD. On examination, the child has asymmetric thigh folds and Ortolani's test is positive. What should be the immediate management?\nClosed reduction only\nPavlik harness\nHip spica\nPemberton osteotomy\nQuestion 6:\nA 1-year-old child is diagnosed with DDH. Closed reduction is attempted but fails. What is the next step?\nTotal hip replacement\nPelvic osteotomy\nManipulation under anesthesia\nOpen reduction\nQuestion 7:\nA 12-year-old boy is diagnosed with DDH with secondary arthritic changes. What is the treatment of choice?\nOpen reduction\nSalter osteotomy\nTotal hip replacement\nFemoral osteotomy\nQuestion 8:\nWhat is the most common type of osteochondrosis?\nFrieberg's disease\nKienbock's disease\nKohler's disease\nPerthes disease\nQuestion 9:\nWhich statement is true about Perthes disease?\nLimitation of external rotation\nMore common in females\nThe bone age is lower than the chronological age\nPatients present during adolescence\nQuestion 10:\nWhich of the following statements is true about coxa vara?\nThe neck shaft angle is increased\nThe greater trochanter is displaced upwards\nLengthening of limb is seen\nLimitation of adduction and internal rotation\nQuestion 11:\nWhich of the following movements is not affected to a great extent in slipped capital femoral epiphysis?\nExtension\nInternal rotation\nFlexion\nAbduction\nQuestion 12:\nA 15-year old boy presents to you with limitation of abduction and internal rotation of the left hip.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe above X-ray shows developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) on the left side. Female gender is a risk factor for DDH.\nThe risk factors for DDH are remembered by 4Fs:\nFemales\nFirstborn\nFaulty intrauterine position (breech)\nFamilial\nSolution to Question 2:\nPerkin's line is a vertical line drawn at the outer border of the acetabulum.\nOption A: Hilgenreiner's line is a horizontal line through the tri-radiate cartilages. Perkin's line is perpendicular to Hilgenreiner's line.\nThe image below shows the vertical Perkin's line and the horizontal Hilgenreiner\u2019s line. Normally the femoral head lies in the inner and lower quadrant formed by these lines. But in DDH the femoral head is in the upper and outer quadrant.\n\nOption C: Shenton's line is a smooth curve formed by the inferior border of the neck of the femur with superior margin of the obturator foramen. It is broken in DDH and fractured neck of the femur.\n\nOption D: Klein's line is a line along the superior aspect of the femoral neck which normally intersects the epiphysis. In slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Klein's line does not intersect the epiphysis and passes superior to it.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nGaleazzi's test is shown in the above image.\nIt is done in children with unilateral cases of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) between 3 to 8 months of age.\nThe child is placed supine with the hip and knee in flexion. The level of both the knee joints is noted with respect to a horizontal line. Normally both knees should be at the same level. In DDH, the affected knee is seen to be at a lower level indicating femoral shortening. This is also known as Alli's sign.\nTests for DDH are:\nBarlow's test\nOrtolani's test\nGaleazzi's test\nAsymmetric skin fold test\nDurkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. In this test, direct median nerve compression elicits paresthesias and pain.\nSolution to Question 4:\nIncreased lumbar lordosis is seen in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).\nOther features include:\nLimb shortenin\nDecreased abduction and lateral rotation of the hip\nAltered gait\nIf unilateral - Trendelenburg's gait (body lurches to the affected side as the child bears weight on it)\nIf bilateral - waddling gait (alternate lurching on both sides)\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of developmental or congenital dysplasia of the hip (DDH). In a child of age &lt;6 months, closed reduction with Pavlik harness or Von Rosen splint is done.\nThe Ortolani's test is a relocation manoeuvre. It is done by placing the infant supine, with the hip and knee flexed. With the thumb placed over the medial thigh and the index finger on the greater trochanter, the hip is gently abducted. This reduces the femoral head into the acetabulum producing a palpable \"clunk''.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe next step for a 1-year-child diagnosed with DDH, with failed closed reduction is open reduction.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe treatment of choice for a case of DDH with secondary arthritic changes in a 12-year-old child is total hip replacement.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe most common type of osteochondrosis is Perthes disease. It is also called coxa plana or osteochondritis deformans juvenilis.\nIt is a disorder causing avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe bone age is lower than the chronological age by 1\u20133 years.\nSince the blood supply of the femoral capital epiphysis is affected, it is characterized by avascular necrosis and disordered enchondral ossification of the primary and secondary centers of ossification.\nPerthes disease typically affects boys aged 4\u20138 years. Patients have short stature and limitation of abduction and internal rotation.\nWhen the hip is flexed it may go into obligatory external rotation called Catterall's sign.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe greater trochanter is displaced upwards in coxa vara.\nIn coxa vara, there is a limitation of abduction and internal rotation. Trendelenburg's gait is seen. The normal femur neck-shaft angle (Mikulicz angle) is from 120-135 degrees.\nIncreases or decreases in the neck-shaft angle result in deformities. An angle &lt;120 degrees is called coxa vara. An angle &gt;135 degrees is called coxa valga.\n\nThe radiograph below shows the reduced angle between the head and shaft of the femur in coxa vara.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nDecreased flexion is seen in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE).\nSCFE refers to the split fracture at the growth plate of epiphysis causing the neck of the femur to slip. The head remains in the acetabulum.\nSCFE occurs during the adolescent rapid growth period when the epiphyseal plate is weak. It is associated with endocrinopathies. It is more common in adolescent boys.\nIt is characterized by:\nDecreased flexion\nRestricted abduction and internal rotation of the hip presenting with difficulty in sittin cross-legged and squattin\nPositive knee axilla sign\nThe following image shows SCFE before and after treatment.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The radiograph shows the Trethowan's sign.\nThe Klein line is a line drawn along the superior aspect of the femoral neck which normally intersects the epiphysis. In SCFE, Klein's line does not intersect the epiphysis and passes superior to it. This is known as Trethowan's sign.\n\nOption B: Catterall's sign is seen in Perthes disease. Option C: Alli's sign is seen in DDH.\nOption D: Dagger sign is seen in ankylosing spondylitis.\nSolution to Question 13:\nHip is held in abduction and external rotation in transient synovitis.\nIn any type of synovitis, the hip joint is held in abduction and external rotation because in this position the joint capacity is maximum, to accommodate the effusion. Hence, the stretching due to effusion is minimal, thus causing less pain.\nSolution to Question 14:\nAchondroplasia is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR-3) gene.\nThe primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes the development of short and thick bones.\nClinical features include:\nShort limbs\nNormal trunk\nLarge head\nSaddle nose\nExaggerated lumbar lordosis\nSevere spinal deformity may lead to cord compression\nThe radiograph below shows champagne glass pelvis in achondroplasia. Bone softening leads to lateral indentation of acetabula.\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe above picture depicts a starfish hand seen in achondroplasia.\nIn these patients, the middle finger is shorter than usual resulting in all digits being of equal length (starfish hand). There is a separation between the middle and ring fingers and this is described as trident hands.\nAchondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate dwarfism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Intelligence and sexual development are usually normal. Hands are short and broad and there is posterior scalloping of the vertebrae.\nSolution to Question 16:\nRing-shaped epiphysis is seen in osteogenesis imperfecta.\nOsteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, is mostly inherited as autosomal dominant. There is a defect in the type I collagen COL1A1 gene\nIt is associated with the following features:\nWormian bones\nMultiple fractures\nDeafness\nBlue sclera\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta. Defective osteoid formation is seen in osteogenesis imperfercta.\nMutation in COL1A1 or COL1A2 results in defective collagen I synthesis and defective osteoid formation.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe most likely diagnosis is slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE).\nAdolescent age group, hypothyroidism, obesity, sudden onset of pain after trauma with restricted abduction, internal rotation are suggestive of SCFE.\nOption A: The age of presentation in Perthes disease is 4-8 years. Option B: DDH is present since birth.\nOption C: Fracture neck of femur is usually seen in the 6th-7th decade of life.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe image shows Barlow's test.\nIt is done to test for Developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH).\nThe Barlow's manouvre is a provocation test. This test is done within 2\u20133 days of birth. To perform this test, the infant is supine with the knees fully flexed and the hip at 90\u00b0 of flexion. The thigh is grasped and the hip is gently adducted to 45 degrees while applying downward and lateral pressure. This results in a posterior subluxation or dislocation of an easily dislocatable femoral head, producing a palpable \"clunk\".\nThis test is positive when the joint can be dislocated and a clunk is heard.\nMetabolic Bone Diseases in Children\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following occur due to nutritional deficiency?",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nOsteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and rickets occur due to nutritional deficiency. Metabolic bone disorders due to nutritional deficiencies include:\nVitamin D deficiency may lead to:\nRickets- in children\nOsteomalacia- in adults\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism\nVitamin C deficiency may lead to scurvy\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to an adenoma or hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. This leads to the unregulated production of parathyroid hormone.\nOsteopetrosis occurs due to decreased osteoclastic activity.\nSolution to Question 2:\nRaised parathormone level and raised alkaline phosphatase along with low serum calcium and low serum phosphate level is suggestive of rickets.\nNutritional rickets occurs due to deficiency of vitamin D. This leads to low calcium levels in the blood. To raise the serum calcium, the secretion of the parathyroid hormone rises. The parathyroid hormone tries to raise the calcium levels by :\nReabsorbing calcium in the kidneys and secreting phosphate in exchange leading to low phosphate levels\nIncreasing bone resorption\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given X-ray shows bow legs or genu varum which is most commonly seen in rickets.\nRickets is a bone mineralization disorder that primarily affects children with open growth plates, resulting from a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate.\nIn toddlers, genu varum is one of the most common initial sign of rickets. In older children, genu valgum or coxa vara might be present.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nWidening of the metaphyseal ends is known as splaying. It occurs because of the accumulation of non-mineralized osteoid at the metaphyseal ends.\nDefective mineralization of osteoid also results in fraying and cupping. Fraying is the worn-out appearance of the metaphyseal margins. Cupping is the concave appearance of the metaphysis. Bowing is seen in the diaphysis of the long bones affected by rickets.\nThe given radiograph shows splaying, fraying and cupping.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nTrummerfeld zone is a radiolucent zone beneath the Frankel's line due to lack of mineralized osteoid.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario and the image showing scorbutic rosary are suggestive of scurvy.\nScurvy results from the deficiency of vitamin C. Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline that are used in the synthesis of collagen. Hence, deficiency of vitamin C leads to the formation of defective collagen.\nDefective collagen results in capillary hemorrhages which may present as generalized bleeding tendency. It also results in defective osteoid formation. Subperiosteal hemorrhages cause acute pain and swelling mimicking acute osteomyelitis.\nCosto-chondral separation leads to the formation of tender nodules, also known as scorbutic rosary. Rickets also presents with similar nodules at the costochondral junctions known as rachitic rosary. They can be differentiated as scorbutic rosary is more sharply angulated and are painful.\nSolution to Question 7:\nMultiple painless swellings at the costochondral junction is suggestive of rachitic rosary in this child. It is not seen in primary hyperparathyroidism.\nRachitic rosary is seen in rickets and all the conditions leading to hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hemangiopericytoma causes hypophosphataemic vitamin D-resistant rickets.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of rickets. Lower limb deformities appear when the child starts to walk. Hence, bowing of legs will be less commonly seen in infants.\nClinical features of rickets:\nLassitude\nMuscle weakness\nConvulsions\nHyperparathyroidism secondary to hypocalcemia\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta. It occurs due to defect in the collagenous matrix of the bone.\nMutations in COL1A1 / COL1A2 results in defective collagen l synthesis. There are 12 types of osteogenesis imperfecta with type 1 being the most common. Triad of fragile bones, blue sclera and deafness is known as Van der Hoeve's syndrome. Treatment includes bisphosphonate therapy and orthopedic rehabilitation.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nMarble bone disease is characterised by decreased osteoclastic activity. It is also known as osteopetrosis / Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease.\nIt is an inherited disorder which may present either in infancy or adulthood. There is continuous new bone formation without bone remodeling. This leads to increased bone density. They are prone to pathological fractures.\nray spine of a patient with osteopetrosis showing endobone (bone within a bone) appearance is given below.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of the infantile form of osteopetrosis. It is characterised by decreased osteoclastic activity due to defect in carbonic anhydrase ll proton pump.\nThe excessive new bone formation with defective resorption leads to abnormal development of the skull, especially causing narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This leads to various complications like hydrocephalus, cranial nerve compression leading to deafness and facial palsy, sinus blockage, etc.\nFailure of bone resorption results in poorly formed medullary cavity. This leads to defective hematopoiesis in the medullary cavity and stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hence, the infant presents with pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly.\nAbnormal bone density may also lead to altered vasculature causing complications like osteitis of the mandible.\nExcess bone density also leads to endobone appearance and rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae on radiograph.

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nGiven the clinical history of an elderly woman experiencing a fracture following a trivial fall, which indicates a pathological fracture, the most probable predisposing condition would be osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormally low bone mass, which makes the bone unusually fragile and increases the risk of fractures.\nA DEXA scan is performed in the following patients to assess bone mineral density and screen for osteoporosis, and the results are reported in terms of T-score or Z-score:\nFemales aged 65 years or more\nMales aged 70 years or more\nPost-menopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors\nFracture after the age of 50 years\nMales aged 50-69 with risk factors\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe DEXA report showing a T-score of -2.8 SD is suggestive of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass.\nT-score of -2.5 SD or lower is suggestive of osteoporosis. In this condition,the degree of mineralization remains the same. It is characterised by increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation or both. There is also a loss of structural connectivity in the trabecular bones.\nSerum calcium, phosphates and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal in osteoporosis.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe MRI of the spine shows decreased bone density with biconcave appearance of vertebrae known as codfish vertebrae. The given clinical scenario and the MRI findings are suggestive of osteoporosis.\nA patient with osteoporosis most commonly presents with chronic back pain or pathological fractures. The most common osteoporotic fractures are compression fractures of vertebrae which lead to the development of kyphosis. Fractures are also seen in the distal radius (colles' fracture) and proximal femur.\nOption A: Lincoln log vertebrae, also called as H-shaped vertebrae are seen in patients of sickle cell anemia. The following image shows the lincoln log vertebrae.\n\nOption B: Picture frame vertebrae in which the cortex of the vertebrae is thickened is seen in Paget's disease.\nOption C: Vertebrae plana is seen in a number of conditions such as:\nOsteoporosis\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nOsteomyelitis\nTrauma\nThis occurs in advanced compression fractures when the vertebral body has entirely lost its height both anteriorly and posteriorly.\nSolution to Question 4:\nOsteoporosis is not seen in systemic sclerosis.\nOsteoporosis most commonly occurs in postmenopausal women and in elderly individuals. The secondary causes of osteoporosis are:\nHypogonadal states -\nTurner's syndrome\nKlinefelter's syndrome\nHyperprolactinemia\nEndocrine disorders -\nCushing's syndrome\nHyperparathyroidism\nHyperthyroidism\nDiabetes mellitus\nHematological disorder -\nMultiple myeloma\nLymphoma\nLeukemia\nHemophilia\nThalassemia\nNutritional and gastrointestinal disorders -\nMalnutrition\nParenteral nutrition\nMalabsorption syndrome\nGastrectomy\nPernicious anemia\nRheumatologic disorder -\nRheumatoid arthritis\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nInherited disorders -\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nMarfan's syndrome\nEhler's Danlos syndrome\nHypophosphatasia\nProlonged immobilization\nPregnancy and lactation\nSolution to Question 5:\nCod fish vertebrae in X-ray spine is suggestive of osteoporosis. The investigation of choice for the diagnosis of osteoporosis is dual energy X-ray absorptiometry(DEXA).\nIt measures the bone mineral density of an individual. These measurements are made at the lumbar spine or the hip. These measured values are compared using T scores. A T score \uf0a3 -2.5 SD is suggestive of osteoporosis.\nSolution to Question 6:\nDual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is routinely done in women at 65 years of age to screen for osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder characterized by abnormally low bone mass, which makes the bone unusually fragile and increases the risk of fractures.\nThe criteria to screen for osteoporosis according to the national osteoporosis foundation is as follows:\nFemales aged 65 years or more\nMales aged 70 years or more\nPost-menopausal females under the age of 65 years with risk factors\nFracture after the age of 50 years\nMales aged 50-69 with risk factors\nA DEXA scan is performed in the above patients to assess bone mineral density, and the results are reported in terms of T-score or Z-score.\nSolution to Question 7:\nZoledronate is bisphosphonate that is administered once a year.\nThe drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis which decrease bone resorption include bisphosphonates, denosumab, and SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators).\nBisphosphonates decrease bone resorption by impairing osteoclast function. The bisphosphonates approved for the treatment of osteoporosis are alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate.\nAlendronate and risedronate can be administered daily or weekly with different dosages.\nIbandronate can be administered daily, weekly or quarterly.\nZoledronate is administered annually.\nDenosumab is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for RANKL. RANKL stimulates osteoclast that results in bone resorption. By inhibiting the RANKL, denosumab prevents activation of osteoclast and decreases bone resorption.\nSERMs: Raloxifene and tamoxifen are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Estrogen decreases bone resorption. Thus decrease in estrogen in postmenopausal females results in increased bone resorption leading to osteoporosis.\nSolution to Question 8:\nSynthetic parathyroid hormone given to a patient with osteoporosis is teriparatide. In low and intermittent doses, it leads to bone formation.In high and continuous doses, it leads to bone resorption.\nOption B: Romosozumab is an anti- sclerostin antibody. Sclerostin inhibition increases bone formation and, to a lesser extent, decreases bone resorption.\nOption C: Cinacalcet inhibits the parathyroid hormone secretion by activating the calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR).\nOption D: Salcatonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption. It is used in the treatment of Paget's disease and osteoporosis.\nSolution to Question 9:\nStrontium ranelate decreases bone resorption and increases bone formation.\nStrontium resembles calcium and moves into bone matrix resulting in increased bone formation. Osteoclasts cannot remove strontium, thus decreasing bone resorption.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe next investigation to be done in a patient with complaints of hip pain following prolonged bisphosphonate therapy is plain radiograph to rule out atypical femur fracture.\nProlonged use of bisphosphonates is associated with two potential side effects:\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw usually following a dental procedure\nAtypical femur fracture - occurs in the subtrochanteric femoral region or along the shaft distal to the lesser trochanter\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe radiographic image of an elderly female's lumbosacral spine shows ballooning of disc spaces, resulting in the characteristic biconcave appearance of vertebral bodies known as the 'codfish' appearance, typically seen in osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease characterised by a diffuse reduction in bone density due to a decrease in bone mass.\nRisk factors for osteoporosis include:\nIncreasing age\nFemale sex\nAlcohol\nSmoking\nPrevious history of fragility fractures\nFamily history of hip fracture\nLow body mass index- less than 18.5 kg/m2\nExcessive usage of glucocorticoids\nOsteoporosis presents with fractures that occur without any trauma or as a result of low-impact trauma. The commonly associated fractures are fractures of the distal part of the radius (Colle's fracture), fractures of the hip, and fractures of the vertebrae. In severe cases, the fracture of vertebrae can cause kyphosis.\nRadiological findings:\nA decreased vertical height of the vertebra due to collapse\nGround glass appearance - especially in bones like pelvis\nCodfish appearance - it occurs due to bulging of the disc into the adjacent vertebral bodies so that it becomes biconcave.\nDEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis o osteoporosis. T-score less than -2.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip indicates osteoporosis.\nSolution to Question 12:\nBone scan and quantitative CT are not commonly used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.\nBone Scan is obsolete whereas QCT measures volumetric bone density. However, this QCT is expensive and has higher risk of exposure to radiation when compared to DEXA, hence it is not\nmuch in use\nThe investigation of choice for the diagnosis of osteoporosis is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). A T-score &lt;\u20132.5 is defined as osteoporosis. DEXA measures the bone mineral density of an individual. These measurements are made at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or hip.\nRadiological features of osteoporosis:\nBallooning of disc spaces leading to the biconcave shape of the vertebral body, known as codfish appearance (classically seen in osteoporosis but also seen in osteomalacia and hyperparathyroidism)\nLoss of vertical height of vertebra due to collapse\nGround glass appearance of bones especially in the bones like the pelvis\nLoss of cortical bone (picture frame vertebrae) and trabecular bone (ghost vertebrae)\nLoss of trabeculae in proximal femur area.\nChemical tests like serum calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels are usually normal. But, osteoblastic and osteoclastic markers in urine &amp; blood can help in diagnosing and monitoring treatment.\nSolution to Question 13:\nOsteomalacia is a disorder of bone mineralization. Osteomalacia means softening of the bone. There is incomplete calcification of osteoid throughout the skeleton.\nThe disorders of bone mineralization include:\nRickets\nOsteomalacia\nHyperparathyroidism.\nRickets and osteomalacia are different expressions of the same disease resulting from deficient mineralization of the bone. Defective mineralization of the epiphyseal growth plates in children causes rickets and defective mineralization of the bone matrix in adults causes osteomalacia.\nIt leads to fragile bones with a high risk of fractures.\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nLooser zones, codfish vertebrae, and champagne glass pelvis are seen in osteomalacia.\nLoosers zones are the classical lesions of osteomalacia. These are due to incomplete stress fractures caused by the arterial pulsations which heal with callus-lacking in calcium. They are thin transverse bands of rarefaction especially seen in the pelvis, the shaft of long bones such as femur neck and the axillary edge of the scapula. They are seen in:\nOsteomalacia (characteristic)\nRenal osteodystrophy\nFibrous dysplasia\nHyperthyroidism\nPaget's disease\nOsteogenesis Imperfecta\nThe image below shows Looser's zone.\n\nCodfish vertebrae are the biconcave vertebral bodies seen in osteomalacia. They are seen in:\nHyperparathyroidism\nOsteomalacia\nOsteoporosis\nThe image below shows the codfish vertebrae.\n\nChampagne glass pelvis is due to bone softening leading to lateral indentation of acetabula. It is seen in:\nOsteomalacia\nAchondroplasia\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nBreast carcinoma does not cause osteomalacia and phosphaturia.\nTumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome which presents with hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia and renal phosphate wasting. It is most commonly seen with mesenchymal tumors.\nTumors associated with osteomalacia are:\nHemangiopericytoma (option B)\nNon-ossifying fibroma\nOsteosarcoma (option A)\nOsteoblastoma\nFibrosarcoma (option C)\nPaget's Disease and Hyperparathyroidism\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following conditions is characterized by increased osteoclastic activity?\nOsteopetrosis\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nOsteomalacia\nPaget\u2019s disease\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is characteristic of Paget's disease?\nDecrease in bone mineralization\nDecreased alkaline phosphatase\nIncreased bone turnover\nIncreased degradation of collagen\nQuestion 3:\nWhich of the following set of findings is likely to be seen in patient's with Paget's disease?",

Hence, it is a disease of increased bone turnover.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nPaget\u2019s disease is characterized by increased bone turnover with enlargement and thickening of the bone. It is also called osteitis deformans.\nIt manifests in 4th and 5th-decade males.\nThe pathologic process in Paget's disease is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone\nresorption followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation. This results in a structurally disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone causing the bones to\nbe unusually brittle. Plasma alkaline phosphatase is increased due to the osteoblastic activity.\nSolution to Question 3:\nPatients with Paget' disease have normal levels of serum calcium and raised serum ALP. It is due to increased bone formation.\nHypocalcemia can be rarely seen in patients with Paget's disease. It is due to active bone formation with insufficient calcium and vitamin D intake.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given X-ray shows blade of grass deformity seen in the osteolytic phase of Paget's disease.\nAn initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization. Radiographically, this manifests as an advancing lytic wedge or blade of grass or flame shaped\nlesion.\nThe second phase is a period of very active bone formation and resorption. It is characterised by normal lamellar bone replaced with haphazard (woven) bone.\nIn the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less vascular mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget\u2019s disease.\nThe arrow mark in the following image indicates blade of grass appearance.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray showing cotton wool skull is suggestive of Paget's disease.\nPharmacological therapy includes use of bisphosphonates and calcitonin. They primarily reduce the rapid bone resorption and also increase the bone formation. Zolendronic acid is the preferred bisphosphonate.\nThe given below X-ray shows cotton wool skull.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray showing ivory vertebrae is suggestive of Paget's disease. Paget\u2019s disease of the bone increases the risk of osteosarcoma and not osteochondroma.\nComplications of Paget's disease are:\nMalignancy\nOsteosarcoma (most common)\nFibrosarcoma\nChondrosarcoma\nSarcoma of myeloid and mesenchymal element\nIncreased risk of fractures due to decreased bone strength\nOsteoarthritis\nBony overgrowth leading to spinal stenosis and nerve compression\nHigh output cardiac failure due to increased blood flow to skeletal bones\nHypercalcemia in patients with prolonged immobilization",

This leads to increased warmth over the limbs. They may also have kyphosis and bowing of legs. Increased bone formation in Paget's disease may lead to the narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This causes compression of the cranial nerves which may lead to deafness.\nDeafness due to the narrowing of cranial nerve foramina is also seen in osteopetrosis. However, it can be differentiated from Paget's disease by the absence of lytic lesions of the bone.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe radiological feature of hyperparathyroidism is subperiosteal bone resorption and not osteosclerosis.\nOsteosclerosis is a disorder that is characterized by abnormal hardening of bone and an elevation in bone density. It is seen in:\nRenal osteodystrophy\nFlurosis\nPaget's disease of bone\nOsteogenic bone metastasis caused by carcinoma of prostate and breast\nOsteosclerosing types of chronic osteomyelitis\nHypervitaminosis D\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe parathyroid hormone does not increase calcium absorption from the intestine directly.\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands. It is regulated by the levels of serum ionized calcium. It stimulates the enzyme 1\uf061-hydroxylase which converts",

It is due to thickened, disorganized bony trabaculae which appear as sclerosis on radiographs.\nOption B: The geographic skull is seen in eosinophilic granuloma. Option D: Multiple punched-out lesions are seen in multiple myeloma.\nNote: Brown tumor in hyperparathyroidism is also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease of bone. Neurofibromatosis l is also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical scenario and the X-ray showing subperiosteal bone resorption in the radial aspect of middle phalanges is suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.\nHyperparathyroidism presents with the classical findings of \u201cbones, stones, groans, moans with fatigue overtones\u201d which occur as a consequence of hypercalcemia.\nThough multiple myeloma and metastatic disease also present with hypercalcemia, subperiosteal bone resorption is pathognomonic of hyperparathyroidism. Normal levels of PTH can help in differentiating these conditions from hyperparathyroidism.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe radiograph given above shows a rugger jersey spine which is a characteristic feature of renal osteodystrophy. The given clinical scenario is suggestive of renal osteodystrophy which is caused by hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal disease.\nRugger jersey appearance is seen due to osteosclerosis of the superior and inferior vertebral endplates. This occurs due to excess osteoid formation by the osteoblasts to counteract increased bone resorption. The term rugger jersey appearance is used because there are alternating bands of increased and decreased bone density, similar to the jersey of a rugby player.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given clinical scenario and the X-ray showing interosseous membrane ossification is suggestive of fluorosis.\nFluorosis first starts as mottling of the enamel of upper incisors. Fluorine stimulates osteoblastic activity and fluorapatite crystals are laid down in the bone. These are usually resistent to secondary osteoclastic resorption. This leads to calcium retention, osteosclerosis, and development of osteophytes. Ossification of ligaments and fascial attachments is characteristic of this condition.\nSolution to Question 14:\nHyperparathyroidism is associated with sub-periosteal bone resorption and not a new bone deposition.\nThe subperiosteal new bone deposition is an important feature of both fluorosis and Caffey\u2019s disease.\nCaffey\u2019s disease also known as infantile cortical hyperostosis is a self-limiting disorder. Classically the onset of the disease occurs before the 5th month of life. It is characterized by\nSoft tissue swelling\nRapid sub-periosteal new bone formation\nCortical thickening of underlying bones\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario and CT of cervical spine showing ossified posterior longitudinal ligament is suggestive of fluorosis. Fluorine stimulates osteoblastic activity and fluorapatite crystals are laid down in bone These are resistant to osteoclastic resorption.\nFluorosis is a disease where excessive deposition of calcium occurs in bone and soft tissues. This leads to calcium retention, impaired mineralization and secondary hyperparathyroidism.\nThe characteristic pathology involves sub-periosteal new bone formation, osteosclerosis and hyperostosis at the bony attachments of ligaments, tendons, and fascia. It is most commonly seen vertebrae, ribs and pelvis.\nThe CT scan given below shows ossified posterior longitudinal ligament.\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe. given clinical scenario is suggestive of hypervitaminosis A.\nHypervitaminosis A more commonly occurs in children following excessive intake. It also occurs in adults who consume polar bear livers. An increased vitamin A level in the body can manifest in the form of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension). X-ray shows increased density in metaphyseal region due to excessive mineralization of bone.\nNote: Hypervitaminosis D also causes metabolic bone disease.\nSolution to Question 17:\nEosinophilic granuloma is the least likely cause of multiple lytic lesions in the skull of an elderly woman. It is a very rare benign bone tumor which presents in the younger age group (5-15 years).\nRheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the most common form of arthritis?\nRheumatoid arthritis\nPsoriatic arthritis\nSeronegative arthritis\nOsteoarthritis\nQuestion 2:\nA 35-year-old man comes with a history of musculoskeletal pain.

The images below show the clinical and X-ray appearances of Heberden nodes in OA.\n\n\nDeformities seen in RA:\nThe image below shows the clinical and X-ray appearance of swan-neck deformity.\n\nThe images below show the boutonniere deformity.\n\n\nThe image below shows the \u2122-deformity.\n\nThe images below show hammertoe.\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe patient with rheumatoid arthritis presents with signs of UMN lesion, indicating spinal cord involvement due to atlantoaxial instability (excessive movement between C1 and C2). An X-ray of the spine in lateral flexion and extension view is required for further evaluation.\nOpen mouth view is also for the atlantoaxial area, but will not demonstrate instability.\nSolution to Question 7:\nGenu valgum is seen in rheumatoid arthritis of the knee. All other options are features of osteoarthritis of the knee.\nRheumatoid arthritis of the knee can also present as triple and quadruple deformity of the knee:\nTriple deformity of the knee - flexion + posterior subluxation + external rotation (commonly seen)\nQuadruple deformity of the knee - triple deformity + valgus\nOsteoarthritis of the knee\nRheumatoid arthritis of knee\nGenu varum more commo n\nGenu valgum more common\nSubchondral sclerosis\nPeriarticular osteopenia\nNo soft tissue swelling\nSoft tissue swelling (pannus)\nOsteophytes\nNo osteophytes\nHard and bony joint\nSoft, warm, and tender joint\nRheumatoid factor negati ve\nRheumatoid factor positive\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe most common pulmonary manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis is pleuritis.\nThe image below shows pleural effusion secondary to pleuritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritits.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nMethotrexate with anti-TNF is superior to any other treatment in limiting progression of joint destruction and disability.\nIn rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint inflammation is the main cause of joint damage and is the most important factor of joint disability and deformities.\nMethotrexate belongs to the category of drugs known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). They slow down or prevent the structural progression of RA and hence are used in most combination therapies. Among the DMARDs, methotrexate is the preferred first-line drug.\nBiologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF agents target cytokines and cell-surface molecules to slow the progression of joint inflammation. These drugs are typically used in combination with background methotrexate therapy.\nCombination therapy with methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is the most commonly used next step for the treatment of patients with deformities, having an inadequate response to methotrexate therapy.\nSteroids are used when rapid control of the disease is required. They have a rapid onset of action, while the DMARDs take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to come into effect. They can be used as a cover during this period. Steroids can also be used in short courses for acute flare-up episodes of RA. Long-term use of steroids is not advised due to their adverse effects such as osteoporosis.\nThey are usually not used alone (option A) but are used as an adjunct to DMARDs like methotrexate (option B).\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as adjunctive therapy for the management of uncontrollable symptoms because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic use is not advised due to their side effects namely gastritis and peptic ulcer disease as well as impairment of renal function (option D)\nHence, among the given options methotrexate with anti-TNF is the best therapy in a patient with deformity.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe earliest pathological change in osteoarthritis is commonly seen in the articular cartilage, which is asymmetrical hyaline articular cartilage loss.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe above image showing the knob-like appearance of the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) in a patient with OA is suggestive of Bouchard's nodes. They are formed due to the formation of osteophytes and tissue swelling.\nHeberden's nodes develop in distal interphalangeal joints (DIP).\nThe images below show Bouchard's (yellow arrow) and Heberden's nodes (black arrow).\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe arrows in the plain radiograph given above show subchondral sclerosis.\nIt refers to a denser area of bone just under the cartilage of the joint, appearing as abnormally white bone along the joint line. It is seen in osteoarthritis.\nRadiographic features of osteoarthritis:\nLocalized joint space narrowing (blue arrows in the image below)\nSubchondral cysts and sclerosis (black arrows in the image below)\nMarginal osteophytes (yellow arrow in the image below)\n\nLoose bodies and chondrocalcinosis\nCentral or subchondral erosions give rise to the seagull wing appearance (as shown below).\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of Milwaukee's shoulder.\nIt is a rapidly progressive destructive osteoarthritis with extensive bone loss, such that the whole head of the humerus disappears. There is the rapid destruction of the rotator cuff and the glenohumeral joint.\nIt is characterized by Intraarticular or periarticular hydroxyapatite crystals.\nSynovial fluid can be stained by alizarin red staining. It is often hemorrhagic with low cellularity\n(&lt;2000 leucocytes/mL) cells.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe above scenario along with the X-ray showing joint space narrowing and osteophytes is suggestive of osteoarthritis of the knee.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nRheumatoid arthritis is not a seronegative arthritis as it is associated with the presence of autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor) in the blood.\nSeronegative spondyloarthropathies are associated with:\nAbsence of autoantibodies\nInvolvement of the spine\nIncreased incidence in young individuals\nHLA B-27\nThey include:\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nPsoriatic arthritis\nReactive arthritis\nEnteropathic arthritis\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe above lateral view X-ray view shows the bamboo spine appearance. It is seen in ankylosing spondylitis.\nIt is due to the ossification of the annulus fibrosis, sparing the anterior longitudinal ligament and disc.\nThe image below shows the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nOther named vertebral abnormalities:\nVertebral abnormalit y\nAssociated condition\nBamboo spine\nAnkylosing spondyliti s\nIvoryvertebra\nPaget'sdisease\nCodfish vertebra\nOsteoporosis\nRugger jersey spine\nRenal osteodystrophy\nCorduroyvertebra\nHemangioma\nPicture frame vertebr a\nPaget's disease\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. Hyperparathyroidism is not an extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe extra-articular manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis are a consequence of uncontrolled systemic inflammation. They include:\nEye - Anterior uveitis (commonest overall) , glaucoma\nRenal - IgA nephropathy, secondary amyloidosis\nCardiac - Aortic regurgitation, aortitis, carditis, conduction defects\nRespiratory - Upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis, pleural thickening\nNeurological - Cauda equina syndrome\nGIT - Inflammatory bowel disease\nDiffuse osteoporosis\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of psoriatic arthritis. The CASPAR criteria is used to make the diagnosis.\nImage A shows psoriatic nail dystrophy and image B shows the arthritic changes with evidence of new bone formation in the 4th DIP on X-ray.\nThe CASPAR criteria includes:\nEvidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasis, or a family history of psoriasis\nTypical psoriatic nail dystrophy observed on the current physical examination\nA negative test result for rheumatoid factor\nEither current dactylitis or a history of dactylitis\nRadiographic evidence of juxta-articular new bone formation in the hand or foot\nOnly current psoriasis is assigned 2 points; all other features are assigned 1 point. To meet the criteria, a patient must have an inflammatory articular disease (joint, spine, or entheseal) with \uf0b33 points from the above five categories.\nOther commonly used criteria include:\nEULAR - Rheumatoid arthritis\nSLICC - Systemic lupus erythematosus\nASAS - Ankylosing spondylitis\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe above image shows the classic 'pencil-in-cup deformity' of psoriatic arthritis with subluxation of the thumb.\nThese changes occur due to periarticular erosion and bony resorption. The images below shows the pencil-in-cup deformity in psoriatic arthritis.\n\n\nOther deformities in psoriatic arthritis:\nMarginal erosions with the adjacent bony proliferation\nSmall joint ankylosis and osteolysis of phalangeal and metacarpal bones\nTelescoping of digits, periostitis, and proliferative new bone\nAxial changes like asymmetric sacroiliitis\nPsoriatic arthritis of the hands commonly involves proximal and distal interphalangeal joints\n(PIP, DIP) and metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP).\nThe image below shows psoriatic arthritis of the hands.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of hemophilic arthritis. Juxta-articular osteopenia is seen in hemophiliac arthritis, not juxta-articular osteosclerosis.\nIt is caused due to repeated hemarthrosis into the joint leading to chronic synovitis and articular cartilage erosion.\nOther radiological features include:\nSoft tissue swelling\nIncrease in intercondylar distance\nSubchondral thinning\nSubchondral bone cyst\nHemophilic pseudotumors\nSolution to Question 7:\nTarsal and tarsometatarsal joints are affected in neuropathic arthritis associated with diabetes mellitus.\nSolution to Question 8:\nMost common joint affected in pseudogout is the knee joint.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe above image shows needle-shaped crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate seen in gout. Bleeding is not a precipitating factor for gout.\nThe precipitating factors for gout include:\nDietary excess\nTrauma\nSurgery\nExcessive ethanol ingestion\nHypouricemic therapy\nSerious medical illness e.g., MI, stroke\nOn polarized microscopy, the crystals appear as negatively birefringent yellow needles (as shown below).\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe image shows Martel\u2019s sign (G-sign) which is periarticular erosions with overhanging margins. It is a radiographic finding in gout.\nThe X-ray findings in gout are:\nAcute attack - soft tissue swelling.\nChronic gout - joint space narrowing and secondary osteoarthritis.\nTophi - characteristic punched out cysts or deep erosions with overhanging bony edges (Martel's sign or G sign).\nComolli's sign refers to a triangular swelling corresponding to the outline of the scapula seen in scapular fracture.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe above scenario is suggestive of pseudogout. Secondary calcium pyrophosphate deposition is associated with hypothyroidism, hence TSH level should be assessed next.\nCommon associations of pseudogout are:\nHypothyroidism\nHypophosphatasia\nHemochromatosis\nHyperparathyroidism\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe above image shows positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals that are seen in pseudogout.\nCrystals on polarised microsc opy\nGout\nPseudogout\nNegatively birefringent\nPositviely birefringent\nNeedle shaped\nRhomboid crystals\nNa Urate (sodium urate)\nCa pyrophosphate\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given clinical scenario of a 40-year-old man with increasing stiffness in the spine, along with CT spine showing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and ankylosis involving the thoracolumbar vertebral bodies points to a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\nAS is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in young males and has a strong association with HLA-B27.\nFeatures of lower back pain in AS:\nAge at onset &lt; 40 years\nInsidious onset\nMorning stiffness &gt; 30 minutes\nImprovement with exercise\nPain persists with rest and is also present at night.\nAlternating gluteal pain\nPersistence for more than 3 months Examination findings in AS:\nLoss of lumbar lordosis\nIncreased thoracic kyphosis\nDiminished spinal movements\nDecreased chest expansion ( &lt;7 cm)\nTenderness over sacroiliac joints\nImportant X-ray features of ankylosing spondylitis:\nSacro-iliac joints:\nCardinal sign/earliest sign is the erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints\nLater- periarticular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint.\nVertebral changes:\nEarly spondylitis is characterized by small erosions at the corners of vertebral bodies with reactive sclerosis: Romanus lesions of the spine (Shiny corner sign)\nSquaring of vertebral bodies or flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the spine due to inflammatory resorption of the bone.\nLater signs are ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs producing syndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae\nBamboo spine appearance is due to bridging at several vertebral levels\nLinear ossification along the central spine, representing interspinous ligament ossification can give a Dagger sign appearance on frontal radiographs.\nCT imaging in AS helps to visualize bone erosions, osteoporosis/osteosclerosis, and new bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes, ligamentous ossification, and ankylosis.\nThe X-ray below shows the bamboo spine appearance in AS:\n\n\nNerve Injuries\nQuestion 1:\nA man, after sleeping the whole night with his arm hanging over the back of the chair wakes up with an inability to extend his wrist.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThis is a case of saturday night palsy, which is a type of neuropraxia.\nNeuropraxia is a reversible physiological block in nerve conduction. Saturday night palsy occurs when radial nerve is compressed in the arm from direct pressure against a firm object. It can occur when the person sleeps on the arm, often after alcohol intoxication. Therefore, it is known as saturday night palsy or weekend palsy.\nOther examples for neuropraxia include crutch palsy and tourniquet palsy.\nSolution to Question 2:\nSprouting axons can form an end neuroma in neurotmesis.\nA neuroma is an overgrowth of fibrous tissue and randomly sprouting axons following nerve injury. A neuroma may form following axonotmesis and neurotmesis. In neurotmesis, neuroma does not bridge the break in continuity and is called end neuroma. In axonotmesis, the neuroma formed bridges the continuity and is called neuroma in continuity.\nTinel's sign is used to assess nerve regeneration following injury. The nerve is percussed along its course to elicit a tingling sensation. The point of tingling marks the site of newly sprouting axons.\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn femoral nerve injury, thigh wasting can occur, not calf wasting. Calf wasting can occur in sciatic nerve injury.\nNerve involv ed\nMuscle wasting\nAxillary nerv e\nFlat shoulder\nMedian nerv e\nThenar eminence\nUlnar nerve\nHypothenar eminence\nUlnar nerve\nHollowing between metacarp als\nFemoral ner ve\nThigh wasting\nSciatic nerve\nCalf wasting\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe clinical presentation is suggestive of anterior dislocation of shoulder. The most common nerve injured in these cases is the axillary nerve as it winds around the humerus.\nIn axillary nerve injury, there is loss of sensation over a small part of the deltoid region in upper arm (regimental badge area) and weakness in abduction (15-90 degress) due to denervation of deltoid. Overhead abduction is unaffected as it is the function of serratus anterior and trapezius muscles.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe image shows Erb's palsy (waiter's tip deformity). In this condition, there is a loss of sensation over a small area of the lower part of the deltoid, and not in the lateral 2 fingers.\nIt is caused by injury to C5, C6, and rarely C7. It is seen most commonly in babies with shoulder dystocia at delivery.\nThe following are seen in Erb's palsy:\nLoss of abduction and lateral rotation of the arm\nLoss of flexion of the elbow\nLoss of supination of the forearm\nLoss of biceps, supinator, and inverse supinator jerk\nLoss of sensation over a small area of the lower part of the deltoid\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn Klumpke's paralysis, there is loss of strength in intrinsic muscles of the hand causing claw hand deformity. The site of injury is at the lower trunk of brachial plexus, where the nerve roots C8 and T1 are affected.\nThe following are seen in Klumpke's paralysis:\nLoss of strength in intrinsic muscles of the hand causing claw hand deformity.\nUnilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome (ptosis, miosis and anhidrosis).\nLoss of sensation along the medial border of forearm and hand.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of injury to musculocutaneous nerve. Musculocutaneous nerve supplies the biceps brachii and a branch of musculocutaneous nerve namely, the lateral cutaneous nerve of forearm supplies the lateral aspect of forearm. So, injury to musculocutaneous nerve results in weakness of flexion at elbow and lack of sensation over lateral aspect of forearm.\nThough axillary nerve is the most common nerve damaged in shoulder dislocation, other nerves such as musculocutaneous nerve and radial nerve can also be damaged.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above picture shows ape thumb deformity. It results from median nerve palsy. Ape thumb deformity is characterized by the inability to abduct and oppose the thumb due to paralysis of opponens pollicis muscle. The thumb remains parallel by the side of other fingers.\nIn the hand, the median nerve supplies muscles of the thenar eminence, mainly abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis and flexor pollicis brevis.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe image shows atrophy of thenar eminence as seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. It is due to compression of the median nerve where it passes under the flexor retinaculum in the wrist.\nPatients present with pain and paresthesia over the radial 3 and a half digits. There may be weakness of thumb opposition. In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but nerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis.\nTinel's sign is positive in this condition. Sensory symptoms are reproduced by percussing over the median nerve.\nPhalen's test is positive where the symptoms are reproduced by holding the wrists in full flexion with the dorsum of the hands pressed together.\nDurkan's test is the most specific test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. In Durkan's test, direct median nerve compression elicits paresthesias and pain.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given image shows the pointing index sign and is associated with median nerve injury at the forearm or elbow.\nMedian nerve supplies flexor digitorum superficialis and lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus muscles. Hence injury to the median nerve leads to paralysis of these muscles. This causes inability to flex the index finger and thumb, leading to the pointing index sign.\nSolution to Question 11:\nA positive pen test is seen in median nerve palsy. It tests the abductor pollicis brevis. The hand must remain flat with palm facing upwards; a pen is held above the palm and the patient is asked to touch the pen with his thumb - Positive sign is the inability to touch the pen.\nTests used in ulnar nerve injuries include:\nWartenberg's sign - Due to weakness of the palmar interossei muscles and unopposed action of the extensor digiti minimi, there is involuntary abduction of the little finger.\nPositive Egawa's test - Due to weakness of dorsal interossei, side to side movements of middle finger is weak.\nPositive book test or Froment's sign - Due to weakness of adductor pollicis muscle, adduction of thumb is lost. When asked to hold a book, patient tries to hold the book by using flexor pollici longus muscle. This produces flexion at inter-phalangeal joint while holding the book.\n\nCard test - Inability to hold a card between the fingers due to loss of adduction by palmar interossei muscles.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nTardy ulnar nerve palsy, also called late ulnar nerve palsy is associated with cubitus valgus deformity.\nCubitus valgus deformity can occur as a complication of fracture of lateral condyle of the humerus. Friction neuritis of the ulnar nerve occurs as it moves over the medial epicondyle in cubitus valgus.\nThe following image shows cubitus valgus deformity:\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe above image shows a knuckle bender splint which is used in the management of ulnar nerve palsy.\nIn ulnar claw hand, there is loss of function of intrinsic muscles of the hand. So, knuckle bender splint is used to flex the metacarpophalangeal joint and extend the interphalangeal joint.\nThe following is an image of the cock-up splint used for radial nerve palsy:\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe most likely nerve injured in this case is the posterior interosseous nerve. The posterior interosseous nerve is a pure motor nerve and hence there is no sensory loss in its injury.\nThe patient cannot extend the metacarpophalangeal joints but wrist extension is preserved as extensor carpi radialis longus is spared.\nThe most common nerve injury associated with Monteggia fracture-dislocation is posterior interosseous nerve injury.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given X-ray shows a shaft of humerus fracture. In this condition, the radial nerve is injured in the radial groove. This is a high radial nerve palsy, where all the muscles supplied by the radial nerve are paralyzed, except the triceps and anconeus.\nThe following are the various levels at which radial nerve injury can occur:\nOccasionally, the radial nerve may be injured high up as in axilla, called very high radial nerve palsy. This can occur due to lesions around the shoulder joint, axilla, and crutch palsy. In thi case, even the triceps may be paralyzed. Extension of the elbow, wrist, and hand are lost in these lesions.\nIn high lesions like fractures of the humerus and prolonged tourniquet pressure, there is wrist drop, due to weakness of the radial extensors of the wrist, as well\nas inability to extend the metacarpophalangeal joints. There will also be sensory loss on the skin over the anatomical snuff box.\nLow lesions occur due to the fracture or dislocations of the elbow. The wrist and elbow extension is preserved but the patient cannot extend the metacarpophalangeal joint. There is also a radial extension of the wrist.\nSolution to Question 16:\nHigh stepping gait is seen in common peroneal nerve injury.\nCommon peroneal nerve supplies the extensors and evertors of the foot. Its injury results in foot drop. So the patient attempts to lift the leg high enough during walking so that the foot does not drag on the floor. This is known as high stepping gait.\nCauses of common peroneal nerve injury:\nFracture of the fibular neck\nPressure from a splint or a plaster cast over the neck of fibula\nIt is treated using an ankle-foot orthosis brace - a type of orthotic used to support the foot and ankle in foot drop.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of sciatic nerve injury.\nSciatic nerve is the most commonly injured nerve during hip replacement surgery especially during posterior approach. Hence, the patient presents with pain and weakness in the area of distribution of sciatic nerve.\nSolution to Question 18:\nPhalen\u2019s test is a provocative clinical test used to detect the compression of the median nerve in carpal tunnel syndrome.\nThe patient is asked to actively place the wrist in complete but forced flexion. The test is considered positive if tingling and numbness are produced in the median nerve distribution of the hand within 60 seconds.\nThe given image shows Phalen\u2019s test:\n\nBenign Tumors Of Bone\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the most common benign tumor of the bone?\nOsteoma\nOsteoblastoma\nOsteochondroma\nUnicameral bone cyst\nQuestion 2:\nAccording to the Enneking system of classification, which of the following is not a feature of an active benign bone tumour?\nIntracapsular location\nWide area of activity\nWell defined margins\nThin rim of reactive bone\nQuestion 3:\nWhich of the following statements is false with respect to a solitary bone cyst?\nThey are asymptomatic unless complicated by pathological fracture\nTrapdoor sign can be seen on X-ray\nThey commonly occur in the diaphysis of the bone\nThey may cause growth abnormalities\nQuestion 4:\nA 14-year-old boy presents to the OPD with pain in the right upper arm and a history of a trivial fall a few days ago. His X-ray is given below. Which of the following is not a treatment modality for the above condition?\n\nCurettage and bone grafting\nIntra-lesional steroids\nRadiotherapy\nInjection of a sclerosing agent\nQuestion 5:\nA 16-year-old girl presented to the OPD with a painful swelling below her left knee. An X-ray is obtained which is given below. Aspiration of the lesion revealed blood. Which of the following statements is true with regards to this condition?\n\nIt is a uniloculated lesion\nIt is central in location\nIt is not locally destructive\nIt can rarely occur in the spine\nQuestion 6:\nThe following X-ray shows a lytic lesion of the lower limb. The biopsy shows fibroblastic proliferation, osteoclast and inflammatory cells. From the given options, the most likely diagnosis that can be inferred from the above clinical picture is\t.\n\nAneurysmal bone cyst\nGiant cell tumor\nChondroblastoma\nLangerhan cell histiocytosis\nQuestion 7:\nA 30-year-old woman developed a tumor at the knee joint. Biopsy-image is given below. What is the most likely condition?\n\nOsteosarcoma\nEwing's sarcoma\nGiant cell tumour\nOsteoblastoma\nQuestion 8:\nIdentify the following correctly.\n",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most common benign tumor of the bone is osteochondroma.\nHowever, osteochondromas are developmental malformations rather than true neoplasms. Hence, osteoid osteoma is the most common true benign tumor of the bone.\nSolution to Question 2:\nAccording to the Enneking system of classification, an active benign tumor will have a narrow z ne of activity.\nSolution to Question 3:\nA solitary bone cyst (unicameral bone cyst/ simple bone cyst) most commonly occurs in the metaphysis of the bone.\nSimple bone cyst always occurs during the first two decades of life, most often between 4-10 years of age with a 2:1 male preponderance. It is a benign unilocular cyst filled with straw coloured serosanguinous fluid.\nThe commonest site is the proximal humerus. They are usually asymptomatic, but pathological fractures may occur through the cyst wall and may cause pain and swelling. The cyst may cause growth disturbances due to its proximity to the growth plate.\nOn X-ray, a bone fracture fragment may be seen resting in a dependent portion of the cyst. This is known as the fallen fragment/fallen leaf sign and it is pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst.\nThe trapdoor sign is a variant of the fallen leaf sign. Here, a periosteal hinge keeps the fragment from falling dependently and allows it to change position with a change in the patient's position.\nSolution to Question 4:\nRadiotherapy is not a treatment modality used in the treatment of the above condition.\nThe given X-ray reveals a fracture running through a central cystic lesion situated on the proximal humeral metaphysis, and also shows a fallen fragment sign. This along with the clinical scenario (male within 2nd decade of life) is strongly suggestive of a unicameral bone cyst (simple bone cyst).\nTreatment of simple bone cyst:\nSmall, asymptomatic lesions - serial observation with plain radiographs as lesions will regress following skeletal maturity\nLarger lesions (at risk of pathologic fracture) and symptomatic lesions -\nCurettage\nAspiration and injection using:\nCorticosteroids\nBone marrow aspirate\nDemineralized bone matrix\nPathological fractures -\nUpper limb: managed conservatively as the fracture may initiate cyst healing\nLower limb: curettage, bone grafting, and internal fixation\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical scenario and X-ray are suggestive of an aneurysmal bone cyst. It can involve the spine in 15-20% of cases.\nAneurysmal bone cysts are eccentric, expansile, multiloculated cysts filled with blood. They\nare benign lesions but they are locally destructive. Most cases occur in patients younger than 20 years old. There is a slight female preponderance.\nThe most common sites involved are the metaphysis of long bones like proximal humerus, distal femur, and proximal tibia. It presents with pain and swelling. Spinal lesions may cause neurologic deficits or radicular pain.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe provided X-ray reveals a lytic lesion in the epiphysis of the distal tibia, and the biopsy, which shows osteoclast cells, suggests a diagnosis of a giant cell tumor (GCT).\nImportant X-ray features of a GCT:\nA solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis.\nEccentric location, most often subchondral.\nExpansion of the overlying cortex.\nSoap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance.\nNo calcification within the tumor.\nNo or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor.\nThe image below shows an X-ray of a giant cell tumor showing the typical soap bubble appearance:\n\nHistologically, GCT is characterized by the presence of a large number of osteoclast-like giant cells among scattered round or spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. The tumor stroma is\nwell-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue. The image below shows the histopathology of GCT:\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Aneurysmal bone cyst usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones and the posterior elements of vertebral bodies. It is characterized by multiloculated blood-filled cystic spaces separated by septae, composed of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and reactive woven bone. Radiographically, an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lesion with well-defined margins. Most lesions are completely lytic and often contain a thin shell of reactive bone at the periphery.\n\nOption C: Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that occurs mainly in bones around the knee joint. On x-ray, the tumor appears as a well-circumscribed, round, or oval lytic lesion in the center of the epiphysis of long bones, with areas of calcification within the tumor, giving the characteristic mottled appearance. On histology presence of \"chicken wire calcification\" is pathognomic.\n\nOption D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis commonly involves the skull, pelvis, femur, and mandible. Radiographs show a lytic lesion with periosteal new bone formation. In the skull, lesions appear as a hole within a hole, and in the vertebra, vertebra plana (flattening of the vertebral body) can be seen. Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or grooved nucleus (\u201ccoffee-bean\u201d appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli. On electron microscopy, the presence of Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm is characteristic.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe biopsy image shows multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells with scattered mononuclear cells, indicating a diagnosis of giant cell tumor (GCT)/osteoclastoma.\nGCT usually affects young adults of age 20 to 40 years, with slight female predominance. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and affects the ends of long bones, typically involving the epiphysis. The most common location of the tumor is the distal femur followed by the proximal tibia.\nHistologically, GCTs show uniform oval mononuclear tumor cells alongside numerous osteoclast-type giant cells containing 100 or more nuclei. Necrosis and mitotic activity may be prominent.\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Histologically, osteosarcoma shows pleomorphic tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant mitoses. A definitive diagnosis requires the presence of malignant tumor cells producing unmineralized osteoid or mineralized bone, which is typically fine and lacelike in appearance.\n\nOption B: Histologically, Ewing's sarcoma shows sheets of uniform, small, round cells with scant cytoplasm, which may appear clear because they are rich in glycogen. The presence of\nHomer\u2013Wright rosettes indicates a greater degree of neuroectodermal differentiation.\n\nOption D: Histologically, osteoblastoma shows randomly interconnecting trabeculae of woven bone, which are prominently rimmed by a single layer of osteoblasts. The stroma surrounding the neoplastic bone is composed of loose connective tissue that contains numerous dilated and congested capillaries.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nAn osteoclastoma or giant cell tumor (GCT) has soap-bubble appearance with minimal marginal sclerosis. It is epiphyseal in location.\nAn aneurysmal bone cyst is eccentrically located, lytic lesion. It is metaphyseal in location. A simple bone cyst is centrally located, lytic lesion. It is also metaphyseal in location\n\nThe below table summarises the findings seen in these conditions:\nGCT\nABC\nSimple bone cyst\nLocation\nEpiphyseo-Metaphyseal\nMetaphyseal\nMeta-diaphyseal\nGCT\tABC\tSimple bone cyst\nGCT\tABC\tSimple bone cyst\nGCT\tABC\tSimple bone cyst\nGCT\tABC\tSimple bone cyst\nCommonly invo lved\nDistal femur/radiusProximal humerus/tibia\nHumerus/femur/tibiaPosteri or spine\nProximal humerus/femur/tib ia\nAge",

The proliferative component of this tumor is made up of mononuclear stromal cells. Their nuclei are identical to\nthe osteoclast-like giant cells which are characteristically seen in this condition.\nGCT is a very aggressive benign tumor arising from the epiphysis and typically in the age group of 20-40 years. It has slight female predominance.\nThe most common site is lower end of femur. It has an egg shell crackling feel on palpation. Benign pulmonary metastasis can occur in about 3% of cases.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given x-ray showing an expansile, eccentric, multiloculated lytic lesion, at the end of a long bone with a soap-bubble appearance suggests a giant cell tumor (GCT) or osteoclastoma. The treatment of choice for this condition is extended curettage and bone grafting.\nGiant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive tumor seen involving the metaphysis and /or the epiphysis of long bones, as seen in the image, in young adults of age 20-45 years and rarely teenagers less than 20 years.\nAlthough an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is also a benign, locally destructive,\neccentric multiloculated lytic tumor that can present with a similar radiographical picture in any age group (most commonly in adolescents), it is confined within the metaphysis of the long bones, unlike GCT, thus ruling it out in this case. On MRI a fluid sign can be seen.\nThe following is an x-ray image of the knee showing ABC confined to the metaphysis of the long bones:\n\nAn ABC is treated by extended curettage and grafting with a bone graft substitute (option B).\nGCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. It presents with complaints of swelling and vague pain and Sometimes, the patient can presents for the first time with a pathological fracture because of the lesion.\nImportant x-ray features of a GCT:\nEccentric, solitary lytic lesion\nIn epiphysis and metaphysis\nExpansile- expands overlying cortex\nSoap bubble appearance - due to the trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing the lytic lesion, giving it a loculated appearance.\nNo or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor\nNo calcification\nHistologically, GCTs consist of undifferentiated spindle cells profusely interspersed\nwith multi-nucleated giant cells. The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue.\nThe treatment of choice for GCT is by\nExtended curettage and bone grafting (Option A).\nGCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction.\nBisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease.\nRadiotherapy can be used for vertebral tumors\nAdditional supportive therapy such as cryotherapy, when used reduce the reccurence rate.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe least rate of recurrence following extended curettage is seen with liquid nitrogen use.\nThis technique is used in the treatment of giant cell tumours as they are locally aggressive, for local tumour clearance and prevention of recurrence.\nIt is applied by the direct pour technique. Complications of this technique include pathological fractures and nerve injuries.\nNote: Even though phenol and methacrylate can also be used as adjuvants for extended curettage, studies have shown that liquid nitrogen is far superior for the purpose.\nSolution to Question 12:\nAneurysmal bone cyst, brown's tumor, osteoclastoma, and osteosarcoma all contain giant cells. Enchondroma and osteoid osteoma do not contain giant cells.\nLesions containing giant cells are:\nSimple bone cyst\nAneurysmal bone cyst\nOsteoclastoma\nChondroblastoma\nFibrous dysplasia\nNon-ossifying fibroma\nBrown's tumor\nOsteosarcoma\nClear cell chondrosarcoma\nThe most common variant of a giant cell tumor is non-ossifying fibroma&gt;fibrous dysplasia.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given X-ray shows a well-defined lobulated lesion located eccentrically and sclerotic scalloped borders is suggestive of non-ossifying fibroma. The common age of presentation of this condition is 2-20 years.\nIt is also known as fibrous cortical defect and it is the most common benign lesion of bone. It is a metaphyseal eccentric lesion that usually affects the distal femur, tibia and fibula.\nOn biopsy, foam cells, spindle shape cells and giant cells may be seen.\nIt is usually asymptomatic and regresses spontaneously in adulthood. If the defect is very large, it can be treated by curettage and bone grafting.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe above X-ray shows bending of the femur known as Shepherd's crook deformity. It is seen in fibrous dysplasia of proximal femur.\nFibrous dysplasia is a developmental disorder in which areas of trabecular bone are replaced by cellular fibrous tissue. If this occurs in the weight-bearing bones like the femur, it will lead to bending of the bones.\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nPolyostotic fibrous dysplasia with intramuscular myxomas is seen in Mazabraud syndrome.\nFibrous dysplasia is a disorder where bone is replaced by fibrous tissue, leading to weak bones, uneven growth, and deformity. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a form of this condition affecting more than one bone.\nMcCune - Albright syndrome consists of a characteristic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe au lait spots with rough borders and hyperfunction of an endocrine system.\nMaffucci syndrome is characterised by multiple enchondromas with soft tissue hemangiomas and phleboliths. Malignant transformation is common in these lesions.\nStewart- Treves syndrome refers to the occurrence of lymphangiosarcoma in the setting of chronic lymphedema. It can be evident as upper extremity lymphedema following radical mastectomy.\nSolution to Question 16:\nCafe-au-lait lesions with rough borders (coast of Maine) are seen in McCune Albright syndrome. Cafe-au-lait lesions with smooth borders (coast of California) is seen in neurofibromatosis.\nFeatures of McCune Albright syndrome:\nPolyostotic fibrous dysplasia - most commonly in maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, femur or tibia\nCafe-au lait spots with rough borders (coast of Maine)\nHyperfunction of an endocrine system - most common endocrinopathy is precocious puberty in girls\nMcCune-Albright syndrome occurs due to activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the G protein Gs alpha.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of an osteoid osteoma.\nThe given X-ray shows the presence of a metadiaphyseal cortical lesion involving the upper end of the femur with radiolucent nidus surrounded by cortical sclerosis.\nThe nidus of osteoid osteoma is present in the cortex as can be seen in the image below. Hence, CT scan is the best investigation to diagnose osteoid osteoma.\n\nOsteoid osteoma is the most common benign bone tumour of the body. It contains osteoblastic as well as osteoclastic components.\nIt is most often seen in young men. The most common site is diaphysis of femur. It typically presents with pain that is worse at night and is relieved by aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiin\u25a0ammatory medications.\nMultiple treatment options are available for this condition as follows:\nIf symptoms are adequately controlled and patient is willing to undergo long-term medical management, anti-inflammatory medication can be used as the definitive treatment. Spontaneous healing of the lesion usually occurs within 3 to 4 years.\nPatients having lesions of the pelvis or long bones of the extremities can be treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. This method is not preferred for vertebral lesions and lesions of small bones of hand and feet.\nSurgical management involves removal of the entire nidus. This can be accomplished by curettage or en bloc resection.\nMagnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation is a new method that is under investigation.\nSolution to Question 18:\nOsteoid osteoma is the least likely cause of multiple bone lesions. It is usually solitary. Differential diagnosis for multiple bone lesions:\nHistiocytosis\nEnchondroma\nOsteochondroma\nFibrous dysplasia\nMultiple myeloma\nMetastases\nHemangioma\nOsteomyelitis\nGiant cell tumor\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe above image shows hemangiomas of the hand. The radiograph shows multiple tumors affecting the small bones of hand with soft tissue swellings and calcification suggestive of enchondromatosis. This is suggestive of Maffucci's syndrome.\nMaffucci's syndrome is characterised by enchondromatosis with hemangiomas of the overlying soft tissue.\n\nMalignant potential of enchondromas:\nMaffucci's syndrome has a 100% risk of turning into malignancy\nOllier disease has a 30% risk of turning into malignancy\nSolitary enchondroma has a &lt;2% risk of conversion to chondrosarcoma\nThe most common tumor affecting small bones of the hand is enchondroma. Ollier disease is characterized by multiple enchondromas when present without hemangiomas.\nMelorheostosis is an uncommon mesenchymal dysplasia manifesting as regions of sclerosing bone with a characteristic dripping wax appearance a.k.a. flowing candle wax appearance. It is als known as Leri disease,\nHaemangiopericytomas are soft tissue sarcomas of vascular origin, comprised of pericytes.\nSolution to Question 20:\nOsteochondroma does not have osteoblast as the predominant cell type. It is made up of physeal chondrocytes showing active cartilage formation.\nOsteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, and osteosarcoma are bone-forming tumors. They show active ossification and have osteoblasts as the predominant histological cell type.\nSolution to Question 21:\nBursitis is the most common cause of pain in an osteochondroma.\nOsteochondromas are common benign bone tumors which are developmental malformations rather than true neoplasms.\nMany of these lesions cause no symptoms and are discovered incidentally. However, some of them may become painful. Causes of pain in an osteochondroma are:\nInflammation of overlying bursa\nFracture of the bony stalk\nCompression of the neurovascular bundle of the limb\nMalignant transformation\nThe following X-ray shows a well-defined exostosis. It emerges from the metaphysis and moves towards the diaphysis. It angles away from the growth plate.\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nMalignant degeneration in an osteochondroma is suggested by the thickness of the cartilage cap exceeding 2 cm.\nThe cartilage cap overlies a bony stalk. It is irregular and usually cannot be seen on radiographs. Occasionally, calcification within the cap may be seen on X-rays.\nOther features suggestive of malignant change in an osteochondroma are:\nPersistence of tumor growth after skeletal maturity\nIrregularly scattered flecks of calcification within the cartilage cap\nSpread into the surrounding soft tissue\nMalignant degeneration of an osteochondroma may lead to development of chondrosarcoma.\nSolution to Question 23:\nTrevor's disease is characterized by the presence of intra-articular epiphyseal osteochondromas.\nIn Trevor's disease, bony lesions appear on the medial or lateral aspect of the epiphysis. The lesions are localized to a single side of the body. Knee and ankle are most frequently involved.\nMultiple osteochondromas are seen in a condition known as diaphyseal aclasis or multiple hereditary exostoses.\nThe below lateral view X-ray of the lower limb shows non-uniform bone growth, and unconnected ossification centers related to the epiphyses at the knee and ankle. This is seen in Trevor's disease.\n\nSolution to Question 24:\nMultiple hereditary exostoses is associated with multiple osteochondromas. Multiple enchondromas are seen in Maffucci's syndrome and Ollier's disease.\nMultiple hereditary exostoses is an autosomal dominant disease. The affected genes are EXT1 and EXT2 which are located on chromosomes 8 and 11 respectively.\nThere is an increased risk of malignant transformation of the osteochondromas in case of multiple lesions (about 5%). Solitary lesions have a 1% risk of malignant transformation.\nThe following X-ray image shows multiple osteochondromas around the knee.\n\nSolution to Question 25:\nAmong the given options, chondroblastoma is an epiphyseal lesion. Epiphyseal lesions include:\nChondroblastoma\nGiant cell tumor in adults\nClear chondrosarcoma\nArticular osteochondroma (Trevor's disease)\n\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is not characterised by the presence of a short 4th metacarpal. This feature is seen in pseudohypoparathyroidism.\nThe skeletal and radiological manifestations of Langerhan's cell histiocytosis are:\nSkull:\nsolitary or multiple punched out lytic lesion without sclerotic rim\ndouble contour or beveled edge appearance (hole-within-a-hole sign)\nbutton sequestra representing residual bone\ngeographic skull\nMandible:\nfloating tooth: loss of lamina dura\nSpine:\nvertebra plana: most common cause of vertebra plana in children; mostly seen in thoracic spine\nSolution to Question 27:\nHistopathologically, cells with grooved nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm can be observed in both Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and chondroblastoma. Therefore, the next step to differentiate between them would be to obtain a CD1a marker, which is typically positive in LCH.\nThe specific markers for LCH are CD1a and langerin (CD207)\nIt is worth noting that while an MRI can provide valuable information for evaluating the pathology, it is ideally performed before the biopsy.\nSolution to Question 28:\nThe image shows the classical polka dot sign(on axial section) and the Corduroy sign /jailhouse appearance(on vertical section). These are seen in vertebral hemangioma.\nThese signs are the result of the replacement of normal cancellous bone by thickened vertical trabeculae.\nThe corduroy sign is shown in the following image.\n\nSolution to Question 29:\nHemangioma arises more commonly from the vertebral body.\nHemangioma is a benign tumor and consists of vascular channels (capillary, venous or cavernous). Apart from the spine, skull is also a common site for hemangiomas.\nBiopsy is rarely needed due to the threat of hemorrhagic shock. Imaging techniques such as CT/MRI are used to make the diagnosis.\nA hemangioma on a limb can lead to local hypertrophy. This can cause localised gigantism.\nMalignant Tumors of Bone\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following is the most common malignant lesion of the bone?\nMultiple myeloma\nEwing's sarcoma\nMetastases\nOsteosarcoma\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following statements about bone tumours are true?",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most common malignant lesions of the bone are metastases.\nThe most common site of metastasis in the skeleton is vertebra. Bony metastases are more common above 50 years of age.\nThe most common primary tumor giving rise to bony metastases is carcinoma breast. However, in children under 6 years of age the most common cause of bony secondaries is adrenal neuroblastoma. Carcinoma lung and carcinoma kidney are often implicated in cases of bony metastases from an unknown primary.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe most common primary malignancy of the bone is multiple myeloma which is a tumor of hematological origin. The most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone\nis osteosarcoma. However, in the first decade of life, the most common non-hematologic primary bone malignancy is Ewing\u2019s sarcoma.\nThe most common malignant lesions of the bone overall are metastases. The non-hematologic primary tumors of the bone arranged in decreasing order of incidence are: osteosarcoma &gt; chondrosarcoma &gt; Ewing's sarcoma.\nThe most common benign bone tumour is osteochondroma. However, it is not a true tumor as it stops growing after skeletal maturity. Hence, the most common benign true bone tumour is osteoid osteoma.\nSolution to Question 3:\nOsteosarcoma is a highly radio-resistant tumour.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given X-ray shows the Codman triangle which is suggestive of osteosarcoma.\nOsteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. Distal femur, proximal tibia and proximal humerus are the common sites.\nThe Codman's triangle is marked out in the X-ray given below. It is formed due to raising of the periosteum by the tumor.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nAmong the given options, osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis as it is a pulsatile bone tumour. Pulsations in the tumour occur due to hypervascularity.\nPulsatile bone tumours include:\nOsteosarcoma\nAneurysmal bone cyst\nAngioendothelioma of bone\nOsteoclastoma/Giant cell tumour\nMetastases from kidney and thyroid carcinoma\nSolution to Question 6:\nChicken wire pattern of calcification on HPE is seen in chondroblastoma. An osteosarcoma shows the following radiological features:\nIrregular destruction in the metaphysis overshadowed by the formation of new bone\nCodman's triangle or lifting of the periosteum due to the formation of new bone inciting a periosteal reaction\nBone formation along the blood vessels within the tumour centrifugally, giving rise to sunburst\n(sunray) appearance\nThe image given below shows the sunburst appearance seen in osteosarcoma.\n\nThe image given below shows Codman's triangle seen in osteosarcoma.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nBone marrow biopsy is not performed for the evaluation of a patient of osteosarcoma. However, a bone biopsy is done for confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathology.\nAn MRI of the involved bone is always done for the evaluation of an osteosarcoma. It shows the extent of the tumour. A bone scan is useful for detecting skeletal metastases.\nAn osteosarcoma can metastasise to the lungs as well so a chest CT may be done. It is a sensitive detector of lung metastases but chest X-rays are done more commonly.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe presence of pleomorphic cells surrounded by osteoid on histological examination is characteristic of osteosarcoma. To establish the diagnosis, osteoid production from the tumour cells must be demonstrated histologically.\nThe image given below shows the histopathology of osteosarcoma.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical scenario, involving a child and a gross specimen revealing a metaphyseal tumor in the distal femur that has infiltrated through the cortex, lifted the periosteum, and extended through the epiphyseal plate, supports the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.\nA giant cell tumor (option A) is primarily an epiphyseal tumor that usually affects adults between ages 20 and 40 years when skeletal maturity is complete. Chondroblastoma (option B) is a benign tumor of childhood most commonly seen in the epiphysis. Osteoid osteoma (option C) is a benign tumor most commonly seen in the diaphysis of the proximal femur.\nOsteosarcoma is the most common non-hematologic primary malignancy of bone. It occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. It is typically metaphyseal. The distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus are common sites.\nMorphologically, osteosarcomas are bulky, gritty, gray-white tumors, often with hemorrhage and cystic degeneration. They destroy cortices, form soft tissue masses, and spread extensively in the medullary canal, replacing hematopoietic marrow. Although infrequent, they may also penetrate the epiphyseal plate or enter the joint.\nRadiological features:\nIrregular destruction in the metaphysis overshadowed by the formation of new bone\nLifting of the periosteum (Codman triangle) due to the formation of new bone inciting a periosteal reaction\nBone formation along the blood vessels within the tumor centrifugally, giving rise to a sunburst\n(sunray) appearance\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nIn the given scenario, as safe margins are difficult to achieve with wide resection of the osteosarcoma, treatment involves:\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy - to control metastasis and to treat micrometastasis\nLimb ablation surgery - as safe margins are difficult to achieve\nAdjuvant chemotherapy - after the surgery to prevent recurrence Chemotherapy is given based on the T-10 protocol. It involves:\nHigh dose methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue\nAdriamycin\nBCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin/doxorubicin)\nLow-grade tumours, with resectable margins, are treated with wide resection and amputation without chemotherapy.\nRadiotherapy can be given pre-operatively to prevent tumor dissemination by surgical trauma.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe earliest site of metastasis in osteosarcoma is the lungs.\nOsteosarcomas are aggressive lesions and metastasize through the bloodstream. Approximately 15% of patients with osteosarcoma have detectable pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given X-ray shows multiple, punched-out, sharply demarcated, lytic lesions without any surrounding reactive sclerosis. This along with the given clinical scenario are suggestive\nof multiple myeloma.\nClinical features of multiple myeloma include:\nChronic low back pain\nIncreased susceptibility to bacterial infections\nAnaemia\nBony tenderness\nThe X-ray given below shows punched-out lytic lesions in the skull of a patient with multiple myeloma. This is characteristically known as the moth-eaten appearance of skull.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe most common symptom in multiple myeloma is bone pain. Clinical features of multiple myeloma:\nBone pain\nFatigue\nWeight loss\nAnemia\nHypercalcemia\nRenal failure\nPeripheral neuropathy\nSusceptibility to bacterial infections\nSolution to Question 14:\nMoth-eaten appearance of bone is seen in multiple myeloma. In this condition, the bone has poorly defined areas of destruction with ragged edges.\nCauses of moth-eaten appearance include: (Mnemonic - FIREMOD)\nFibrosarcoma\nInfection\nRound cell tumors (Ewing\u2019s sarcoma)\nEosinophilic granuloma\nMetastasis/ myeloma/ malignant fibrous histiocytoma\nOsteosarcoma\nDesmoid tumor\nThe skull X-ray given below shows moth-eaten appearance seen in multiple myeloma.\n\nNote: Moth-eaten calyx is seen in genitourinary tuberculosis.\nSolution to Question 15:\nHyperglycemia is seen as a paraneoplastic symptom in patients with chondrosarcoma.\nMaffucci syndrome is a condition where the patient has multiple enchondromas and soft tissue hemangiomas. It is associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma.\nChondrosarcoma is a malignant metaphyseal tumour most commonly located in a proximal location such as the pelvis, proximal femur, and proximal humerus. It arises in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification, which is punctate, popcorn or comma-shaped in appearance. Treatment is wide local excision/radical excision.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe most common site for adamantinoma is tibia.\nAdamantinoma is a rare malignant diaphyseal neoplasm that arises from epithelial cells. Patients usually present with pain and X-rays show honeycomb or soap bubble appearance.\nSolution to Question 17:\nEwing's sarcoma arises from the mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow. Histologically, Ewing's sarcoma consists of small blue cells with very little intercellular matrix.\nThe most common translocation seen in Ewing's sarcoma is t(11;22) (q24;q12).\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe most probable diagnosis is Ewing's sarcoma.\nThe clinical vignette of a 12-year-old boy presenting with fever, swelling over the right leg, an elevated leukocyte count, ESR and CRP, MIC-2 staining being positive and the X-ray showing onion skin appearance are all suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma.\nIt is a highly malignant tumour that frequently affects males between 10 and 20 years of age. It usually affects the diaphysis of long bones like the femur and tibia. The femur is the most commonly affected, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula, but overall the pelvis accounts for the majority of cases.\nPain is the earliest symptom, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Serologically, the ESR and WCC may be elevated and haemoglobin may be reduced.\nAn x-ray shows an aggressive, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction and periosteal reaction. A distinct \u2018onion-skin\u2019 appearance is observed due to the destruction of the cortex and new bone formation in layers.\nHistologically, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, small, round blue cells with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm that bears no resemblance to normal tissue. The characteristic translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 results in a fusion gene,\nEWSR1-FL11, which is present in 90% of cases. The presence of the translocation may be\nsupported by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nImmunohistochemical staining for MIC-2 is specific for Ewing\u2019s sarcoma.\nThe most common sites of metastasis include lungs, bones and lymph nodes. Bone marrow involvement is a unique feature of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma.\nPreoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide results in extensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvant radiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. Definitive radiotherapy rather than surgical excision may be advocated if it is non-resectable or metastasis has occurred. It is a radio-sensitive tumour.\nIndicators of a favourable prognosis include younger age, involvement of distal appendicular sites, small tumour volume, normal ESR and greater chemotherapy response.\nSolution to Question 19:\nPAS staining is positive in Ewing's sarcoma, as tumour cells are rich in glycogen. However, they stain negatively for reticulin.\nThe image given below shows PAS staining done in Ewing's sarcoma.\n\nNote: Lymphomas are PAS negative and reticulin positive.\nSolution to Question 20:\nIn Ewing's sarcoma, the lesion is most commonly seen in the diaphysis of a long bone.\nEwing's sarcoma is a highly malignant tumour. It is the most common malignancy of the first decade but its incidence is maximum in the second decade.\nFemur is the most common long bone site. Other common sites include the flat bones, pelvis and calcaneum.\nSolution to Question 21:\nFever is one of the indicators for poor prognosis in Ewing's sarcoma. Indicators of poor prognosis in patients with Ewing's sarcoma:\nPresence of distant metastasis - worst prognostic factor\nSize and location of the primary lesion\nPresence of fever, anaemia\nLeukocytosis\nRaised ESR\nMale child and age 12\u201315 years\nHistologic grade is of no prognostic significance because all Ewing's sarcomas are considered high grade.\nNote: High levels of beta 2 microglobulin is an indicator of poor prognosis in multiple myeloma.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe most likely diagnosis in the given clinical scenario is chordoma.\nChordoma is a rare malignant tumor arising from the primitive notochordal remnants. It is the most common primary malignancy of the sacrum. Radiographically, chordomas appear as\ndestructive lesions. Since sacrococcygeal lesions can be obstructed by bowel gas, a lateral X-ray or MRI is used in diagnosis.\nThe image given below shows an MRI of a chordoma.\n\nOn histopathological examination, a chordoma shows cells containing abundant vacuolated cytoplasm known as physaliferous cells. They are arranged in long strands or chords in\na mucinous background as seen in the image below.\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe genetic abnormality seen in synovial sarcoma is chromosomal translocation t(x;18)(p11;q11). This translocation gives rise to SYT- SSX fusion gene.\nSynovial sarcoma is a misnomer as the tumour does not arise from the synovium but the histological appearance resembles normal synovial tissue. It is an uncommon malignant mesenchymal neoplasm.\nSynovial sarcomas are morphologically biphasic i.e. they have nests of epithelioid cells surrounded by malignant spindle cells.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe winking owl sign is seen in spinal metastases. It refers to the appearance of the spine when a pedicle is absent.\nThe usual appearance of the pedicle representing two eyes on the AP projection is lost, as one pedicle is destroyed. It then appears like one eye is open and the other is winking or\nshut. Potentially, all bony metastasis can do this. However, breast cancer and lung cancer are commonly associated with this condition.\nThe image given below shows an X-ray with winking owl sign.\n\nSolution to Question 25:\nBrain is not a common site of primary tumour for bone metastasis. Most tumours metastatic to bone are from:\nBreast\nProstate\nLung\nKidney\nThyroid\nGastrointestinal tract\nSolution to Question 26:\nRenal cancer produces pure osteolytic secondaries. Osteolytic secondaries are produced by:\nRenal cancer\nMultiple myeloma\nMalignant melanoma\nThyroid carcinoma, except medullary carcinoma thyroid Mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic secondaries are produced by:\nLung cancer\nBreast cancer\nLymphoma\nOsteoblastic secondaries are produced by:\nProstate cancer\nOsteosarcoma\nMedullary carcinoma of thyroid\nSolution to Question 27:\nThe given X-ray shows a fracture of the lumbar vertebrae. In the given scenario, this is suggestive of pathological fracture due to bony metastases. This can be evaluated with Mirels scoring system. It does not include response to bisphosphonates as one of the variables.\nMirels scoring is given below:\nProphylactic internal fixation should be considered in a patient with a score of \uf0b38.\nVariable\nScore",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe instrument used in the elevation of the periosteum is a periosteal elevator shown in image A.\nIt is used to elevate the periosteum, as nerves and vessels are generally on this plane, and once elevated there is a safer plane for surgery.\nOption B: The image shows a curette used for curetting a cavity in the bone or removing fibrous tissue from the ends of a fracture. It is used in the management of enchondroma, GCT, and osteomyelitis.\nOption C: The image shows an osteotome. It has both sides beveled and is used for cutting bone in surgeries such as McMurray's osteotomy and corrective osteotomy.\nOption D: It shows a bone gouge, a concave-bladed chisel used for cutting round bone surfaces or making holes in the bone.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe above radiograph shows a K-nail (Kuntscher nail), identified by the absence of interlocking screws. A cloverleaf shape is seen on cross-section. This is designed to give a good rotational stability.\n\nK-nails have been used for the internal fixation of femur fractures, and fixation relies on the frictional fit between the nail and bone. It is based on the concept of three-point fixation i.e., at proximal and distal ends of the bone and at the isthmus (the narrowest part of the medullary cavity).\nThe eye at the end of the nail is useful for removing it after the fracture has healed. Some common complications of K-nailing include:\nThe nail getting stuck\nSplintering of the cortex while hammering the nail\nProximal migration of the nail, leading to bursitis over its protruding end\nDistal migration of the nail leading to stiffness of the knee\nInfection.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given instrument is a cancellous screw.\nCancellous screws have a larger thread and high pitch. Compression is produced by partial threading with a blunt tip.\n\nA malleolar screw is a modified cancellous screw with a sharp-pointed tip.\n\nCortical screws have a smaller thread and low pitch. Compression is produced by over-drilling the proximal cortex.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nOf the following, Kirschner's wire can be used in both the internal fixation of small bones and Ilizarov's technique.\nDenham pin is used for giving skeletal traction in osteoporotic bone. It has threads at the center of the pin, as shown below.\nFeatu res\nSteinmann's Pin\nKirschner's wire (K-wire)\nDiam eter\n>1.5 mm",

The rate of compression/distraction is 1 mm per day, not 2 mm per day.\nIlizarov's technique is based on the principle of distraction osteogenesis. This is the mechanical induction of new bone which occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart.\nCompression and distraction at the fracture site enhance osteogenesis.\nA careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator system called a ring\nfixator. Transfixing thin Kirschner wires (K-wires) are the key components of the Ilizarov fixator regarding its axial stiffness. This affects the mechanobiological environment in which the bone heals.\nDistraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fracture or corticotomy site. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day.\nThe uses of Ilizarov's apparatus are as follows:\nLimb lengthening\nNon-union\nDeformity correction\nOsteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone\nArthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones Disadvantages of this technique include pin tract infection, nerve palsy, and joint stiffness. The below images show the Ilizarov apparatus and an illustration of distraction osteogenesis.\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe above radiograph shows an extramedullary implant called a dynamic hip screw. Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur can be treated by:\nExtramedullary implants - dynamic hip screw\nIntramedullary implants - proximal femoral nail and gamma nail.\nDynamic hip screws are used in undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures, whereas proximal femoral nails are used in displaced intertrochanteric fractures.\nThe below image shows a dynamic hip screw.\n\n\nAdvantages of using a proximal femoral nail over a dynamic hip screw include:\nSmaller incisions\nReduced blood loss\nDecreased femoral neck shortening\nDecreased risk of infection\nThe below image shows a proximal femoral nail with locking and stabilization screws.\n\n\nAustin Moore's implant is an older implant used in unipolar hemiarthroplasty. It can be identified by the fenestrations on the shaft of the prosthesis, as shown below.\n\nHerbert screw is cannulated and threaded at both ends. It is designed for use in fractures of small articular bones such as carpals and scaphoid.\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe instrument given is a bone nibbler, which is designed to remove or shape small sections of bone by gently nibbling or biting away at the bone tissue.\nIt is available in various sizes and with different angles of the nose:\nStraight nibbler \u2013 for general use.\nCurved nibbler \u2013 for spinal surgery.\nDouble-action nibbler \u2013 straight or curved. The double-action reduces the force required for cutting the bone and is mechanically superior.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above image shows a rail fixator.\nIn this type of external fixator, multiple pins are inserted into the bone. These pins are then attached to different blocks which can move over a track or rail.\nGiven below is an Ilizarov ring fixator. Here, pins are attached to an adjustable ring system.\n\nTension band wiring is used in the fixation of transverse patellar fractures. In this method, two K-wires are used to transfix the reduced patellar fragments and a flexible wire is looped around them tightly.\n\nThe following X-ray image shows tibial intramedullary interlocking nailing.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe image shown is of bone holding forceps (Verbrugge forceps). It is used to hold the bone and plate.\nIt consists of a ratcheted clamp with a curved distal end.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe image shows the picture of a Thomas splint and its length is calculated by measuring the distance between the highest point on the medial side of the groin to the heel and adding 6 inches.\nThe ring size is calculated by adding 2 inches to the thigh circumference at the highest point of the groin.\nThe Thomas splint is used for immobilization following hip and thigh injuries. Parts of the splint include:\nOuter bar\nInner bar\nRing\nThe outer bar has a curvature near its junction with the ring to accommodate the greater trochanter.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe above image shows the aeroplane splint, which is used in brachial plexus injury. It maintains the axilla at 90\u00b0.\nA hanging cast is used to treat a shaft of humerus fracture.\n\nInferior dislocation of the shoulder is also known as luxatio erecta, as shown below. It is managed by closed reduction and post-reduction immobilization using a sling.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image shows Gallow\u2019s traction which is used to treat fracture of shaft femur in children less than 2 years old and less than 12 kg in weight.\nHere, skin traction is applied to both legs which are then suspended from a frame, providing just enough traction to keep the buttocks of the child just off the bed.\nOlder children are treated with Russell\u2019s traction or Thomas splint. After 2\u20134 weeks, when the fracture has sufficiently healed, it is replaced by a hip spica.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe device shown in the image is a cock-up splint. It is used to manage radial nerve palsy.\nRadial nerve palsy manifests as an inability to dorsiflex the wrist and digits (wrist drop and finger drop). Numbness occurs on the dorsoradial aspect of the hand and the dorsal aspect of the radial 3 1/2 digits. The cock-up splint is designed to counteract the wrist drop position by holding the wrist in a slightly extended or neutral position, which helps prevent further contracture and allows for functional use of the hand.\nOther options:\nOption B: Undisplaced Colles' fracture is managed by immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast for six weeks. Displaced fractures are managed by manipulative reduction followed by immobilization in Colles' cast in palmar flexion, pronation, and ulnar deviation.\n\nOption C: Knuckle bender splint is used in cases of ulnar claw hand where ulnar nerve recovery is anticipated. The splint can be used to correct and prevent metacarpophalangeal hyperextension by maintaining flexion as shown below.\n\nOption D: Dynamic finger splint can be used for:\nImmobilization in case of fracture of the proximal phalanx\nExtensor tendon injuries of the finger\nPrevention of deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.\nPost-operative immobilization.\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nPerkin's traction is used to treat fractures of the shaft of femur in adults, not cervical spine injuries.\n\nTrauma amputations, prosthetics and joint replacement surgery\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following is the most common cause of amputations?\nMalignant bone tumours\nCrush injury\nPeripheral vascular disease\nRecurrent sepsis\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is not an indication for amputation?\nFulminant gas gangrene\nAnkle-brachial index &lt; 0.45\nSevere peripheral vascular disease\nTranscutaneous oxygen tension 40mmHg\nQuestion 3:\nA construction worker is brought to the casualty following a crush injury to his right lower limb. Which of the following scores can be used to decide between amputation and\nlimb-salvage surgery?\nGustilo Anderson score\nRevised Trauma Score\nMangled Extremity Severity Score\nTrauma Injury Severity Score\nQuestion 4:\nA patient suffering from leprosy is prescribed a Jaipur foot prosthesis in the rehabilitation center. Which of the following statements is true about this prosthesis?\nRestricted mobility\nSquatting is not possible\nInversion and eversion are not possible\nPossible to walk on uneven ground\nQuestion 5:\nA patient presented to the casualty with left lower limb trauma. He underwent amputation of the limb and the tibial nerve was buried. After 2 months he presented with severe neurogenic pain with ambulation. What is the best treatment option for this patient?\nIntra-articular injection of steroids\nTranscutaneous electric nerve stimulation\nRevision surgery\nInterferential therapy\nQuestion 6:\nA blind patient from a low socioeconomic background suffered severe trauma to his upper limbs. The following procedure was performed on this patient. What is this amputation known as?\n\nLisfranc's\nSyme's\nChopart\u2019s\nKrukenberg's\nQuestion 7:\nA patient presents with gangrene of the foot. On examination, there is necrosis extending up to the navicular bone without the involvement of the talus and calcaneum. Which amputation is more effective in the given condition without excessive loss of bone and soft tissue?\nTransmetatarsa\nLisfranc's\nChopart\u2019s\nSyme's\nQuestion 8:\nAmputation at the level of tarso-metatarsal joint is being performed in a patient with diabetic foot ulcer. What is this amputation known as?\nChopart\nPirogoff\nSyme\nLisfranc\nQuestion 9:\nIn which of the following conditions, is joint replacement surgery not done?\nOsteoarthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nSeptic arthritis\nQuestion 10:\nIdentify the option which is correctly matched with the name of the components marked in the picture.\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\nOption 3\nOption 4\nQuestion 11:\nA young adult sustained a fracture in the shaft of the femur following a road traffic accident. Which among the following statements is incorrect regarding the correction of his condition?\nRussel traction may be used in this patient\nMetaphyseal fractures or fractures extending intra-articularly are the only indications for primary plating\nMIPO is a type of biological fixation\nSoft tissue damage is maximal in MIPO technique\nQuestion 12:\nIdentify the prosthesis in the given image.\n\nAustin-Moore prosthesis\nThompson prosthesis\nJepson hip prosthesis\nBohlmann prosthesis\nQuestion 13:\nWhich of the following statements is false about metal on metal implants?\nHigh carbon cobalt chromium alloy has been shown to have lower wear rates\nIt cannot be used in the patients with renal failure\nThese implants are avoided in young females\nPatients with these implants have normal levels of cobalt and chromium levels in serum\nQuestion 14:\nWhich of the following patients are at risk for heterotopic bone formation after hip arthroplasty?",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nPeripheral vascular disease is the most common cause of amputations.\nAmputation is defined as removal of the limb through a part of the bone. Disarticulation is the removal of the limb through the joint.\nCauses of amputations can be classified into 3Ds:\nDead\nPeripheral vascular disease\nSevere trauma\nBurns\nFrostbite\nDangerous\nMalignant tumour\nPotentially lethal sepsis\nCrush injury\nDamned nuisance\nSevere pain\nGross malformation\nRecurrent sepsis\nSevere loss of function\nNote: In India, road traffic accidents (RTAs) are the top cause, while globally, peripheral vascular diseases, often linked to diabetes, are more common. Overall, peripheral vascular disease occurs more frequently than RTAs worldwide, unless the question specifies the primary cause in India, which would be crush injuries from RTAs.\nSolution to Question 2:\nTranscutaneous oxygen tension values below 20 mmHg are an indication for amputation.\nFulminant gas gangrene, ankle-brachial index &lt; 0.45, and severe peripheral vascular disease are indications for amputation.\nTranscutaneous oxygen pressure measurement is believed to be the most reliable and sensitive test for wound healing. The pressure may be falsely low in areas of edema, cellulitis, and venous stasis changes.\nSolution to Question 3:\nMangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) score can be used to decide between amputation and limb salvage in crushing injuries.\nComponents of MESS are:\nShock\nIschemia\n\u2022elocity\nAge\nTotal score is 11. Six or less is consistent with a salvageable limb. Other scores to assess if the limb is salvageable or not are:\nLimb salvage index\nGanga score\nOption A: Gustilo Anderson Classification is used to classify open fractures.\nOption B: Revised Trauma Score (RTS) characterizes the injured patient\u2019s condition by incorporating the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate.\nOption D: Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) comprises Injury Severity Score (ISS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), age of the patient and mechanism of Injury (blunt/penetrating).\nSolution to Question 4:\nIt is possible to walk on uneven grounds with Jaipur foot prosthesis as subtalar movements\n(inversion and eversion) are present. Different types of foot prostheses are:\nJaipur foot\nSolid ankle cushion heel (SACH)\nStationary attachment flexible endoskeleton (SAFE), similar to Jaipur foot. The above features make the Jaipur foot more suitable for the Indian scenario.\nProsthesis\nSACH\nJaipur foo t\nAppearance\nDoes not look nor mal\nLooks nor mal\nWalking barefoot\nNot possible\nPossible\nMobility\nRestricted\nAllowed\nDorsiflexion\nAbsent\nPresent\nInversion/Eversi on\nAbsent\nPresent\nSquatting\nNot possible\nPossible\nCost\nHigh\nLow\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nRevision of transtibial amputation should be done in a patient experiencing exquisite neurogenic pain with ambulation as buried tibial nerve can form postoperative neuroma.\nTransected nerves should not be buried, placed on tension, or compressed as doing so will promote the development of a postoperative neuroma. They should simply be transected sharply and allowed to retract into the soft tissues proximally.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for the treatment of mild to moderate pain in acute or chronic setting. Interferential current therapy (ICT) is another variant of TENS, but works at a much deeper level of the targeted tissue.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given image is of Krukenberg's amputation.\nIn this procedure, the radius and ulna are split to make a pincer mechanism. It has been recommended in blind patients with bilateral below-elbow amputation or in patients who can't afford expensive prostheses (to provide some amount of function).\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn the given scenario, Chopart's amputation is preferred because the talus and calcaneum are not necrotic and can be preserved.\nChopart\u2019s amputation is done at the level of transverse tarsal joints i.e between the articulation of calcaneus with the cuboid and the articulation of talus with navicular bone.\nSolution to Question 8:\nAmputation at the level of tarso-metatarsal joint is known as Lisfranc amputation.\nSolution to Question 9:\nJoint replacement surgery is not done in septic arthritis.\nActive infection at the joint is an absolute contraindication for joint replacement surgery.\nSolution to Question 10:\nComponents of total knee replacement prosthesis are:\nFemoral component (A)\nPatellar button (B)\nPlastic spacer tibial base plate (C)\nTibial implant (D)\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nIn MIPO (minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis) technique, soft tissue damage is minimal.\nMIPO is a type of bridge plating or biological fixation (option C). Here, the plate is fixed proximally and distally and the central fracture area is rendered untouched. Hence, fracture hematoma and soft tissue damage are minimised.\nOption A: Gallow's traction, hip spica and Russel traction are measures commonly used in children. But Russell's traction can also be used in adults as a first-aid measure.\nOption B: Metaphyseal fractures or fractures extending intra-articularly are the only indications for primary plating.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given image shows Thompson's prosthesis.\nThompson prosthesis is used in hemiarthroplasty to replace the head of the femur. It is specially indicated in cases where the neck of the femur is absorbed. It can be used with or without cement.\nThompson prosthesis has no fenestrations. Austin-Moore prosthesis contains two fenestrations in the stem which are for the growth of bone as shown in the images below.\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nPatients with metal on metal implants have high levels of cobalt and chromium in serum, erythrocytes, and urine.\nHigh carbon cobalt-chromium alloy carbides are 5 times harder than the metal matrix and have lower wear rates.\nImpaired renal function leads to increased accumulation of cobalt and chromium compounds in the blood and hence, contraindicated in patients with renal failure. They are also transported through the placenta, hence they are not used in women of childbearing age.\nSolution to Question 14:\nPreoperative radiation is effective in preventing heterotopic bone formation after hip arthroplasty. Risk factors for heterotopic bone formation after hip arthroplasty are:\nPosttraumatic arthritis\nHypertrophic arthritis\nDiffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis\nPaget's disease\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nHistory of heterotopic bone formation in either hip\nHeterotopic bone formation around the hip is seen in about 20% of patients 5 years after joint replacement. Treatment consists of NSAIDs for 3\u20136 weeks post-operatively or a single dose of radiation.\nSolution to Question 15:\nIn uncemented arthroplasty, hydroxyapatite increases the formation of new bone.\nUncemented arthroplasty is preferred in younger patients. Prosthesis contains pores or mesh on the surface to enhance bone growth. The prosthesis stem remains attached to the bone by bone ingrowth.\nSolution to Question 16:\nIn patellar clunk syndrome, the scar tissue which is formed at the superior pole of the patella becomes impinged during knee extension.\nPatellar clunk syndrome is seen after posterior-stabilized knee arthroplasty. A fibrous nodule forms on the posterior surface of the quadriceps tendon just above the superior pole of the patella. This can become entrapped in the intercondylar notch of the femoral prosthesis and cause the knee to \"clunk\" at 30- 45 degrees to the femoral axis while the patient actively extends the knee.\nThe recommended treatment is arthroscopic debridement of the nodule.\nSolution to Question 17:\nDegloving is the avulsion of skin and subcutaneous fat from the underlying fascia, muscle or bone.\nDegloving injuries can be open or closed. An example of open degloving injury is finger avulsion injury with loss of skin. Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehicle collisions).\nThe extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may be\nnon-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic haemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavall\u00e9e lesion.\nPatterns of degloving injury:\nLimited degloving with abrasion or avulsion\nNon-circumferential degloving\nCircumferential single plane degloving\nCircumferential multiplanar degloving\nAssessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one surgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show fixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the degloved skin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue.\nIntravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialist equipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less\nrisk of allergy.\nOpen degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. Closed degloving injuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue and sclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.\nThe given image below shows a degloving injury of the lower limb:\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given image shows ankle-foot orthosis (foot drop brace) which is commonly used in foot drop. Foot drop occurs due to common peroneal nerve injury.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe technique of plaster cast wedging involves the plaster cast being cut circumferentially at the level of fracture and not above the level of the fracture.\nIn certain situations, after the fracture is reduced and the plaster applied, a check x-ray may show some angulation. The angulation is corrected by forcing open a cut on the concave side of the angulation and the plaster is reinforced with extra bandages.\n\nSports Injury\nQuestion 1:\nYou notice your senior resident performing the following test in a patient with an acute painful knee. Identify the test.\n\nAnterior drawer test\nMcMurray's test\nLachman test\nApley's test\nQuestion 2:\nA young footballer is brought to the OPD by his teammates. He says that while tackling his opponent, he had heard a sudden 'pop' followed by severe pain in his right knee. On examination, the joint appears slightly swollen. Which of the following statements is false about his injury?\nIt is a component of the O' Donoghue triad\nIt can lead to hemarthrosis\nAnterior drawer test is preferred for evaluation\nIntercondylar fractures of tibia can lead to this injur\nQuestion 3:\nThe unhappy triad of O'Donoghue refers to :\nDamage to medial meniscus, LCL, and PCL\nDamage to medial meniscus, ACL, and MCL\nDamage to lateral meniscus, ACL, and MCL\nDamage to lateral meniscus, LCL, and PCL\nQuestion 4:\nA 26-year old athlete presented with sudden pain in her right knee after performing a heavy deadlift.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe test shown in the image is the anterior drawer test. This is done to detect injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).\nThe patient is made to lie supine on the examining table. The hip is flexed to 45\u00b0 and the knee is flexed to 90\u00b0 with the foot flat on the examination table. The upper end of the tibia is held in both hands and is gently pulled anteriorly. Increased displacement compared to the normal knee indicates injury to the ACL.\nLachman test is also done to detect injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament. Here the leg is in slight external rotation and the knee is in a mid-flexed to 20\u00b0 position. One hand is placed to stabilize the femur, while another hand applies the anterior force to the proximal tibia, as shown below.\n\nApley's grinding test and McMurray's test are done to detect meniscal injuries.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe above clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Lachman test is preferred in a swollen and acutely painful knee.\nThe anterior drawer test is not preferred in a painful knee, as it may not be possible to carry out the test in the conventional 90\u00b0 flexed position.\nLachman test: The leg is kept in slight external rotation and the knee is in a position between flexion and extension. One hand is placed to stabilize the femur, while another hand applies the anterior force to the proximal tibia, as shown below.\n\nThe ACL is an intraarticular extra-synovial structure. Hence patients with an ACL injury can present with hemarthrosis. It is attached to the intercondylar area of the tibia, therefore intercondylar tibial fractures can lead to ACL injury.\nSolution to Question 3:\nO\u2019 Donoghue triad refers to the injury of:\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\nMedial (tibial) collateral ligament (MCL)\nMedial meniscus\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given clinical scenario and a positive McMurray's test indicate a meniscal injury.\nIn this test, the patient is made to lie in the supine position and the knee is completely flexed. One hand is used to stabilize and palpate the knee joint, while the other hand is used to internally or externally rotate the leg, depending on which meniscus is to be tested. The leg is then slowly extended. Any palpable or audible click indicates injury to the menisci.\n\nOther tests used to detect meniscal injury include:\nApley's grinding test\nThessaly test\nSquat test\nEge's test\nJoint line tenderness test\nApley's test: In this test, the patient is made to lie in the prone position. The knee is flexed to 90\u00ba and rotated while a compression force is applied, which is called the grinding test. The reproduction of symptoms indicates a torn meniscus. The distraction test involves repeated rotation while the leg is pulled upwards by the examiner, holding the thigh down. This produces increased pain only if there is ligament damage.\n\nThessaly test: With the affected knee flexed to 20\u00ba and the foot placed flat on the ground, the patient bears his full weight on that leg while being supported by the examiner. The patient is then asked to twist his or her body to one side and then to the other three times. This test has shown a high diagnostic accuracy rate (95%) in detecting meniscal tears.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nMeniscal injury is mainly caused by rotational force on a partially flexed knee.\nThe rotational forces at the knee compress and rotate the menisci anteriorly or posteriorly, causing a tear. The medial meniscus is less mobile than the lateral meniscus and hence is more prone to injury.\nSolution to Question 6:\nMedial collateral ligament injury does not lead to hemarthrosis, as it is an extra-articular structure.\nThe cruciate ligaments and menisci are intra-articular structures and hence their injury leads to hemarthroses.\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn a patient with an injury to the tibial (medial) collateral ligament, the abduction or valgus stress test would be positive.\nThe abduction or valgus stress test is done as follows:\nThe patient is made to lie in the supine position.\nOne hand of the examiner is placed on the lateral aspect of the knee for support.\nThe other hand is placed over the ankle.\nGentle abduction or valgus stress is applied to the knee while the hand at the ankle externall rotates the leg slightly, and the knee is flexed to 30\u00b0.\nThe test is said to be positive when pain is reproduced, or there is excessive gapping at the medial joint. The below image shows the abduction or valgus stress test.\n\nAdduction or varus stress test is positive in patients with a lateral collateral ligament injury.\nDial test is used to assess the posterolateral instability. This occurs when there is damage to the lateral collateral ligament, popliteofibular ligament, and popliteus tendon.\nSolution to Question 8:\nPatella baja is an abnormally low-lying patella and is not responsible for recurrent dislocation of the patella.\nCauses for recurrent dislocation of the patella include:\nExcessive joint laxity as in connective tissue disorders like EDS, Marfan's syndrome\nPatella alta - the patella is high-lying in the shallow part of the inter-condylar groove\nTrochlear dysplasia\nSmall patella\nGenu valgum\nGiven below is a lateral radiograph of the knee joint showing the Insall-Salvati index. This is the ratio of the patella tendon length (LT) to the length of the patella (LP).\nIn patients with high-lying patella, the ratio is above 1.2. This is known as patella alta.\nIn patients with low-lying patella, the ratio is below 0.8. This is known as patella baja.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe presence of swelling around the medial malleolus and increased medial joint space on radiography indicates injury to the deltoid ligament.\nThe deltoid ligament is present on the medial side of the ankle joint and the fibers are attached to the medial malleolus. Hence injury to it can lead to the widening of the medial joint space, best\nvisualized on the mortise view of an ankle radiograph.\nThe below image shows the attachment of the deltoid ligament.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe above clinical scenario and positive Thompson's test point to a diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture.\nAchilles tendon rupture is usually seen in those playing sports like squash, badminton, and football. The pain is acute and the patient can feel a ripping or popping sensation at the back of the heel. The patient would be unable to plantarflex the affected foot.\nIn Thompson's test, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table. The examiner squeezes the calf muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, with his hand. This should normally cause contraction of the Achilles tendon, resulting in plantar flexion. If the Achilles tendon is completely ruptured, plantar flexion would be absent.\nAchilles tendinitis is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the local irritation of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achilles tendon. On examination, there may be thickening of the tendon with inflammation over the affected area.\nUltrasound may be needed to exclude tendon tear or rupture. It is usually treated by physiotherapy.",
