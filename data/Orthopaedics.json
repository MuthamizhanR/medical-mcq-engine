The patient would be unable to plantarflex the affected foot.\nIn Thompson's test, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table.

If the Achilles tendon is completely ruptured, plantar flexion would be absent.\nAchilles tendinitis is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the local irritation of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achilles tendon.

Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehicle collisions).\nThe extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may be\nnon-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic haemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavall\u00e9e lesion.\nPatterns of degloving injury:\nLimited degloving with abrasion or avulsion\nNon-circumferential degloving\nCircumferential single plane degloving\nCircumferential multiplanar degloving\nAssessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one surgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show fixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the degloved skin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue.\nIntravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialist equipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less\nrisk of allergy.\nOpen degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. Closed degloving injuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue and sclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.\nThe given image below shows a degloving injury of the lower limb:\n [Image Reference: Orthopaedics_img_53.jpeg, Orthopaedics_img_581.jpeg]"
