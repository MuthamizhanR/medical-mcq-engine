This occurs as a result of immune reconstitution due to simultaneous administration of ART and ATT.\nIt is characterized by high fever, lymphadenopathy, expanding intra-thoracic lesions, and worsening of chest X-ray findings. Diagnosis should be made only after ruling out treatment failure and other infections. For severe cases, prednisone 1-2mg/kg is used for 1-2 weeks and then gradually tapered.\nHowever, in patients with CD4 &lt;50/\uf06dL, the benefits of administering ART immediately after initiating ATT outweigh the risks of IRIS, and therefore ART should be started as early as possible.\nNote: As per RNTCP guidelines, CBNAAT is the preferred diagnostic technique for testing TB in PLHIV (people living with HIV).
