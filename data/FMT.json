This helps in viewing both erupted and unerupted teeth. It is a more accurate method of estimating age than emergence, because emergence is an event whose exact time of occurrence is not accurately known.\nThe study of dental microstructure is the most accurate method of age determination in childhood. This involves counting perikymata (incremental lines on the surface of tooth enamel).\nNote: Eruption is a continuous process by which a tooth moves from its crypt in the jaw bone to its position of occlusion in the mouth. It is different from emergence. Emergence denotes that a tooth has pierced the gingiva.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe earliest tooth to erupt in a 7-month-old baby (primary dentition) is a mandibular central incisor.\nThe time of emergence of primary dentition or temporary teeth:\nThe deciduous teeth all emerge into the mouth by 2.5-3 years.\nThe time of emergence of secondary dentition or permanent teeth:\nNote: 6-13 years is the age of mixed dentition. First molar emerges at 6-7 years. Second molar emerges at 12 years and third molar emerges beyond 18 years of age.\nTooth\nEmergenc e\nMandibular central inciso r",

It is mainly useful in adults over 25 years of age.\nGustafson\u2019s criteria includes:\nAttrition - wear and tear changes of occlusal surface\nPeriodontosis - regression of gums surrounding the tooth resulting in loosening of the tooth and falling\nSecondary dentin - deposition of dentin in pulp cavity\nCementum apposition - deposition of cementum in the root forming incremental lines\nRoot resorption - involves both cementum and dentin\nTransparency of the root - This is the most reliable criteria.

Teeth will be numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the central incisor till the third molar in each quadrant.\nThe image given below shows Palmer's notation for teeth charting.\n\nThe 4 most commonly used methods in dental charting are:\nUniversal system: Teeth are numbered 1 \u2013 16 starting from upper right to upper left and 17 \u2013 32 starting from lower left to lower right. The image given below shows the universal dental charting system.\n\nPalmer's notation: Teeth will be numbered from 1 to 8 starting from the central incisor till the third molar in each quadrant. The image given below shows Palmer's notation for dental charting.\n\nHaderup system: This is similar to Palmer's notation but plus sign (+) indicates upper teeth and minus sign (-) indicates lower teeth.\nFDI (Federation Dentaire Internationale): Number is assigned to each quadrant and that number is placed before tooth's number. The quadrants and teeth are numbered as in the images given below.\n\nModified FDI: The quadrants numbering is modified as shown below.\n\nPearson's, Trotter and Gleser's and Steele's formula are used to estimate the stature of the individual.\nSolution to Question 9:\nIn FDI notation 43, the number 4 indicates the lower right quadrant and the number 3 indicates canine tooth. Hence 43 indicates the lower right canine.\nFDI (Federation Dentaire Internationale) represents a number is assigned to each quadrant and that number is placed before tooth's number.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe spheno-occipital suture fuses by about 18\u201320 years in females and by about 20\u201322 years in males.\nThe timing of cranial suture closure was one of the first techniques used to estimate the age of adult individuals. The spheno-occipital suture on the skull base is particularly useful for aging young adults. The other cranial sutures show more variation in the timing of closure. Sagittal suture is used for age determination.\nSutures ossify on the endocranial surface before they ossify on the ectocranial surface, and this must also be taken into account when using this method. Overall, this method of age determination is less reliable.\nAge of fusion of skull sutures:\nSuture\nAge of fusio n\nMetopic suture",

Thus, from birth to 5 years. Thus from birth to 5 years , the calendar of appearance of ossification centres is used for aging.\nAfter the age of 5 years, the fusion of epiphyses acts as a calendar up to the age of 25.\nThe analysis of the hand and the wrist is the recommended method for living age diagnostics. But, this technique frequently does not provide sufficient evidence to place an individual older than or younger than key threshold ages - 16, 18 or 21. Additional radiographs needed to establish the threshold ages of 16, 18 or 21 can be any of the following:\nProximal humerus\nDistal end of the ulna or radius\nDistal femur\nProximal tibia\nIliac crest\nThe proximal end of the ulna cannot be used to conclusively state that the individual is more than 16 years.

More recently, researchers Suchey and Brooks described six phases of degenerative change in the pubic symphysis.\nTo solve this controversy, the following is suggested:\nA two-step procedure has been developed for estimating age:\nIf by looking at the skeleton, the age of the individual seems to be within the first 3 phases of the Suchey\u2013Brookes pubic symphysis method, then this should be the method of choice.\nIf the subject is classified in the last 3 phases, then one should switch to the Lamendin technique in order to assess age more accurately.\nCurrently, age diagnosis at over 60 remains a problem.\nIn early adulthood, Suchey-Brookes pubic symphysis method is most accurate. In late adulthood, Lamendin technique of dental age estimation is most accurate.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe ossification centre for distal tibia does not appear before birth. It appears 3 months after birth.\nNearly all secondary centers commence ossification after birth, although a few develop in the last few weeks of intrauterine life. Secondary ossification centres which are already present when an infant is born include:\nCalcaneus\nTalus\nDistal femur\nProximal tibia\nCuboid\nHead of humerus\nVisualization of the secondary ossification centers of the distal femur and the proximal tibia and commencement of ossification in the calcaneus and talus is usually accepted as signifying a\nfull-term fetus.\nSolution to Question 15:\nCapitate is the first carpal bone and pisiform is the last carpal bone to ossify.

These are small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars.\nThe image below shows Carabelli\u2019s cusps seen in caucasian races.\n\nFeatures of mongoloid dentition include:\nShovel-shaped upper central incisors - Posterior surfaces of these teeth have a central depression\nEnamel pearls - Small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface\nTaurodontism (bull-tooth) - Pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep\nA congenital lack of the third upper molar\nThe image below shows shovel-shaped upper central incisors seen in mongoloid races compared to non-shovel shaped incisors:\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe cusps of molars are wide and deep and cusps of incisors are shovel-shaped in Mongoloid races.\nAfricanoid races tend to have large teeth and often have more cusps on their molars, even up to eight, with two lingual cusps on the mandibular first premolars as an additional common finding.\nIn Caucasian races, the lateral incisors in the upper jaw are usually smaller than the central. They also have long pointed canine roots. Small nodules on the lingual surface of maxillary molars, called Carabelli\u2019s cusp are most common in Caucasian races.\nIn mongoloid teeth, enamel pearls and small nodules of enamel on the tooth surface, are much more frequent. The condition of bull-tooth or taurodontism is most common in Mongoloid people. The pulp cavity of molars is wide and deep, and the roots are fused and bent. A congenital lack of the third upper molar is most commonly seen. The lingual and labial ridges are more prominent.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe preauricular sulcus is useful for sex determination. It is a groove on the iliac bone broad and deep in a female pelvis and narrow and shallow in a male pelvis.\nThe differences between male and female pelvis are summarized in the table below.\nCharacteristic\nMale pelvis\nFemale pelvis\nGeneral Morphology\nMassive, rougher, marked m uscle attachments\nLess massive, slender, smoot her\nOverall shape\nDeep funnel\nFlat bowl\nPreauricular sulcus\nNarrow, shallow\nBroad, deep\nAcetabulum\nLarge, wider, deeper\nSmall, narrower\nBody of pubis\nNarrow, triangular, thick\nBroad, square\nObturator foramen\nLarge, oval with base upward\nSmall, triangular with apex f orwards\nSubpubic angle\nV-shaped, narrow, (70o)\nU-shaped, rounded, wide, (9 0o)\nGreater sciatic notch\nSmaller, narrower, deeper\nLarger, wider, shallower\nIschial Tuberosity\nInverted\nEverted, more widely separat ed\nPelvic Brim\nHeart-Shaped\nCircular or elliptical\nPelvic outlet\nSmaller\nLarger\nSacroiliac articulation\nLarge extends to 21/2to 3 vert ebrae\nSmall, oblique, extends to 2 t o 21/2vertebrae\nSacroiliac joint surface\nLarge and less sharply angula ted\nL-shaped and elevated anteri orly\nCharacteristic\nMale pelvis\nFemale pelvis\nSacrum\nLonger, narrower, with more evenly distributed curvature, promontory well marked.

Body of first sacr al vertebra is small.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe number of Barr bodies in someone with 47XXY genetic makeup is 1, not 2. The number of Barr bodies is given by the formula n-1, where n is the number of X chromosomes.\nBarr body is a small planoconvex mass, lying near the nuclear membrane. It represents the inactivated X chromosome. Barr bodies are seen in 0-4% of genetic males (46XY) and 20-80% of genetic females (46XX).\nSites for sampling for sex chromatin include\nBuccal mucosa\nTooth pulp\nHair bulb\nDavidson body is a drumstick-shaped mass of chromatin hanging down from neutrophil nuclei. It is seen only in females (0-6%).\nSolution to Question 8:\nSternal index, corporobasal sacral index, and ischiopubic index are used to determine the sex of the individual.\nThe intermembral index and cephalic index are helpful in determining the race of the individual. Indices for sex determination:\nIndices\nCalculation (x100)\nMale\nFem ale\nIschiopubic index\nLength of pubis/Length of isc hium\n<90\n>95\nCorporobasal inde x\nTransverse diameter of body of S1 / Breadth of base of sacr um",

This is because most marked changes regarding sex differences occur in the skeleton post-puberty.\nIn prepubertal skeletons, the chance of a correct sex allocation is only 50%. If the pelvis is present, the chances of correct sex allocation increases to about 80%.\nSolution to Question 11:\nAmong the given options, a large acetabulum (only 5) is the characteristic of a male pelvis.\nTriangular obturator foramen, U-shaped pubic angle, everted ischial tuberosity, large greater sciatic notch, deep preauricular sulcus are characteristics of a female pelvis.\nThe differences between male and female pelvis are summarized in the table below.\nCharacteristic\nMale pelvis\nFemale pelvis\nGeneral Morphology\nMassive, rougher, marked m uscle attachments\nLess massive, slender, smoot her\nOverall shape\nDeep funnel\nFlat bowl\nCharacteristic\tMale pelvis\tFemale pelvis\nCharacteristic\tMale pelvis\tFemale pelvis\nCharacteristic\tMale pelvis\tFemale pelvis\nPreauricular sulcus\nNarrow,shallow\nBroad,deep\nAcetabulum\nLarge, wider, deeper\nSmall, narrower\nBody of pubis\nNarrow, triangular, thick\nBroad, square\nObturator foramen\nLarge,oval with base upward\nSmall,triangularwith apex for wards\nSubpubic angle\nV-shaped, narrow, (70o)\nU-shaped, rounded, wide, (9 0o)\nGreater sciatic notch\nSmaller, narrower, deeper\nLarger, wider, shallower\nIschial Tuberosity\nInverted\nEverted, more widely separat ed\nPelvic Brim\nHeart-Shaped\nCircular or elliptical\nPelvic outlet\nSmaller\nLarger\nSacroiliac articulation\nLarge extends to 21/2to 3 vert ebrae\nSmall, oblique, extends to 2 t o 21/2vertebrae\nSacroiliac joint surface\nLargeand less sharply angula ted\nL-shapedand elevated anterio rly\nSacrum\nLonger, narrower, with more evenly distributed curvature, promontory well marked.

In a female skull, both frontal and parietal eminences are larger.\n\nDifferentiating features between male and female skull:\nThe features given above develop after puberty and are modified by senility. Hence, the differences are applicable only between 18-55 years.\nThe image given below shows a male and female skull.\nThe red arrow indicates frontal bossing, which is more apparent in the male skull.\nThe green arrow indicates nasal radix which is deeper in the male skull.\nThe yellow arrow indicates greater prominence of the chin in the male skull.\nThe blue arrow shows a greater mandibular height in the male skull.\nTrait\nMale\nFemale\nGeneral size\nLarge\nSmall\nArchitecture\nRugged\nSmooth\nSupraorbital ridge s\nProminent\nLess prominent\nMastoid process\nProminent\nLess prominent\nOccipital region\nMarked muscle markings\nNo marked muscle marki ngs\nFrontal eminences\nSmall\nLarge\nParietal eminence s\nSmall\nLarge\nOrbits\nSquare with round margi ns\nRound with sharp margi ns\nMandible\nLarge, broad ramus\nSmall, small ramus\nChin shape\nU-shaped\nV-shaped\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe Bertillon system is used for identification based on anthropometry.\nThe origins of forensic anthropology can be traced to the end of the nineteenth century when the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon devised the first classification and identification system to identify criminals, based on anthropometry.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe approximate height of the individual is 150 cm.\nThe stature/femur relationship is 3.74. Thus, stature can be calculated by using the formula, stature = femur length x 3.74 = 40 x 3.74 = 149.6 cm \uf040 150 cm\nThe relationship between the mean stature and the mean length of the femur appears to be fairly stable around the world. However, this factor tends to overestimate tall and underestimate short individuals.\nSolution to Question 16:\nPearson\u2019s formula is used for the estimation of stature. Methods of determination of stature:\nPearson's formula: Any bone may be used, but the measurement of one or more of the six long bones provides the most reliable estimates. The descending order of usefulness of bones is femur&gt; tibia&gt; humerus&gt; radius.\nTrotter and Gleser's method - Formula for stature (cm) = 1.30 (Femur + Tibia) + 63.29 (+/-2.99)\nStature/femur relationship - The relationship between the mean stature and the mean length of the femur appears to be fairly stable around the world which is 3.74.\nAnatomical method - This is the most accurate method. It consists of the sum of the following parameters:\nBasibregmatic height of the sku\nHeight of the vertebrae from the axis through the first sacral vertebra\nBicondylar length of the femur\nPhysiological length of the tibia\nArticulated height of the talus and calcaneus\nConstant is added to account for the soft tissues\nNote: Pearson also introduced the principle of regression.\nSolution to Question 17:\nGestational age of this fetus is 6-7 months.\nCrown rump length + length of lower limb = crown heel length\nRule of Haase enables the estimation of the age of the fetus in lunar months from its crown-heel length (in cm).\nAccording to the rule,\nAge in months = Square root of crown-heel length (when the crown-heel length is 25 cm or less/ first 5 months).\nAge in months = crown-heel length divided by 5 (when the crown-heel length is more than 25 cm/ last 5 months).\nHere, crown heel length = Crown rump + lower limb length = 31 cm. Hence, gestational age = 31 / 5 = 6-7 months.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe length of the vertebral column is 35% of the stature of an individual\nBone\n% of heig ht\nHum erus",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nEdmond Locard is famous for his theory of exchange or Locard\u2019s exchange principle.\nThis theory states that every contact leaves a trace. When two objects come into contact with one another, each will take something from the other object or leave something behind.\nLocard is also renowned for his contribution to the improvement of dactylography, an area of study that deals with fingerprints. He developed the science of poroscopy, the study of fingerprint pores, and the impressions produced by these pores.\nSolution to Question 2:\nFingerprint patterns are determined by the 4th month of gestation and remain fixed throughout life.\nFingerprints are impressions of patterns that are formed by papillary or epidermal ridges at the fingertips. They begin to appear between 12-16 weeks of intrauterine life. The formation is completed by 24 weeks. At birth, a fine pattern of ridges is seen on the skin of the bulbs of the fingers and thumbs, parts of the palms, and the soles of the feet.\nSolution to Question 3:\nLoops are the most common fingerprint pattern encountered. Patterns of fingerprints:\nLoops (60-70%)\nRadial\nUlna\nWhorls\nConcentric\nSpiral\nDouble spiral\nAlmond shaped\nArches\nPlain\nTented\nComposite\nCentral pocket loop\nLateral pocket loop\nTwinned loop\nAccidentals\nThe image given below shows the different patterns of fingerprints.\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nPlain arches have no delta.\nClassification of fingerprints into different patterns is based on delta and core formation. Delta is a triangular arrangement formed where three separate ridge line flows come together. Core is the centermost portion of a ridge flow pattern.\nThe number of delta and core for each pattern is given below.\nThe image given below shows the delta and core in the different fingerprint patterns. For each type, the position of the core is marked with a green circle, and the delta is marked with a blue triangle.\nPattern\nDelta\nCore\nLoop",

    "question_text": "\n\nNote: Dactylography or dermatoglyphics is the study of fingerprint patterns. The first fingerprint bureau in India was established in Kolkata.\nSolution to Question 5:\nLatent prints can be made visible by ultraviolet spectrum lighting, application of lead powder and cyanoacrylate fuming.\nLatent prints are those that are left behind through interaction of hands, palms, and feet with the environment. Occasionally these prints are left cleanly so as to be clearly visible to the unaided eye. It is more often the case that the prints are only partially visible or not visible at all without the use of specialized fingerprint-processing methods and equipment.\nMethods to enhance fingerprints:\nLighting or photoluminescence\nWhite light\nUltraviolet spectrum\nPhysical method - dusting a surface with a fine powder of contrasting color such as:\nWhite: Lead carbonate\nBlack: Charcoal\nGrey: Aluminium dust or chalk powder + mercury\nChemical\nNinhydrin\nCyanoacrylate fuming\nSilver nitrate\nSolution to Question 6:\nHistological sections up to a depth of 0.6mm from the surface of the skin give satisfactory fingerprints. Since the ridges extend up to the dermis, fingerprints can be obtained from the dermis as well.\nSolution to Question 7:\nFingerprint pattern differs in identical twins.\nFingerprints are formed during intrauterine life due to friction ridges. These ridges are created by pressure on the fingers from touching the surroundings. Hence, it is unique to every individual.\nSolution to Question 8:\nA person suffering from dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR) has a lack of fingerprint patterns, and hence will not leave fingerprint marks.\nThere are two closely related autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndromes causing complete absence of fingerprints. They are Naegeli\u2013Franceschetti\u2013Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS) and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR).\nA permanent damage of fingerprints also occurs in patients with leprosy, electrical injury, and irradiation.\nSolution to Question 9:\nEdgeoscopy is a method of identification through the examination of the unique details and characteristics found along the edges of individual fingerprint ridges.\nMethods of identification using different prints:\nDactylography - evaluation of finger prints\nPoroscopy - evaluation of sweat pore openings on fingerprint ridges\nCheiloscopy - evaluation of lip prints\nPodography - evaluation of foot prints\nRugoscopy - evaluation of palatal rugae\nRidgeology - evaluation of friction ridges on fingerprints\nNote: Locard is known as the father of poroscopy, edgeoscopy and ridgeology.\nSolution to Question 10:\nMethods for deliberate tattoo removal include:\nSurgical excision\nScarification with sandpape\nApplication of caustic soda\nElectrolysis\nQ-switch laser method - non-invasive and effective method for removing tattoos without scarring\nAll other methods depend upon damage to the epidermis and dermis, with consequent inflammation and scar formation. The tattoo is removed but replaced with a cicatrix, which will itself indicate that something pre-existed at that site.\nAttempts at the deliberate removal of tattoos are common to remove evidence of identity.\nNote: If the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used to produce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.\nSolution to Question 11:\nBlack areas in a tattoo are the least likely to fade over years.\nThis is because the black pigment (carbon particles) are more resistant than the other pigments to transportation by the lymphatic system. Thus, they tend to persist in the skin.\nColors such as blue, green, or red are scavenged by tissue cells and leached into the lymphatic system after a number of years or decades. Light colors such as white, pink, and blue fade faster.\nChemicals used in different tattoo pigments are:\nBlack pigment - Carbon\nGreen pigment - Potassium dichromate\nRed pigment - Mercuric chloride\nIf the tattoo mark is absolutely invisible or has been removed artificially, the pigments used to produce them may be detected by histological examination of the lymph node.\nSolution to Question 12:\nInk blotting is not used to visualize tattoos. A faded tattoo mark can be visualized by:\nUltraviolet light\nInfrared photography\nRubbing the part and examining it with a magnifying lens\nIn decomposed bodies, the tattoo marks can be visualized by removing the epidermis with a moist cloth. The lymph nodes near a tattoo mark also show a deposit of the pigment.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe lymph nodes should be examined in this case.\nSome amount of material or dye used for creating tattoo marks is transported through lymph to the regional lymph nodes. Hence, in cases where a tattoo mark has disappeared naturally or has been removed, the lymph nodes must be examined.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe cuticle completely covers the hair shaft in human hair. It only partly covers the hair shaft in animal hair.\nHuman hair has 3 parts:\nCuticle - outermost laye\nCortex - middle laye\nMedulla - innermost part\nHuman hair can be identified by the following features:\nThick cortex i.e. medullary index &lt;0.3\nPigment present only in cortex, where it is evenly distributed\nPattern of scales are imbricate or flattened\nThe image given below shows the structure of hair.\n\nNote: Medullary index = diameter of medulla / diameter of hair.\nBNS, BNSS, and BSA\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following provisions is included in BNS Section 22/IPC section 84?\nChild under 7 years is not liable for the act\nA person of unsound mind is not liable for the act\nA person who has committed an act under involuntary intoxication is liable\nA person who commits an act under voluntary intoxication is not liable\nQuestion 2:\nA newspaper editor discloses the identity of a victim of rape without prior permission. He would be tried under which of the following sections?\nBNS 71/IPC 376\u2021\nBNS 72/IPC 228A\nBNS 73/IPC 228A (3)\nBNS 74/IPC 354\nQuestion 3:\nA middle-aged man tried to abscond so that he could avoid service of summons.

Hence, it was not added to the text of the BNS.\nAbetment of suicide (support or aid to commit suicide) is defined under Section 108 BNS (306 IPC). It states that if any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.\nSection\nDeals with\nBNS 107/ IPC 305\nAbetment of suicide of child or person of unsound mind\nBNS 108/ IPC 306\nAbetmentof suicide of a sane individual\nBNS 109/ IPC 307\nAttempt to murder\nBNS 110/ IPC 308\nAttempt to commit culpable homicide\nIPC 309(not added to B NS)\nAttemptto commit suicide\nSolution to Question 17:\nDowry Death is defined under section 80 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 (IPC 304B).\nIf a husband or his relative subjects the woman to cruelty or harassment in demand of dowry within 7 years of marriage, they shall be deemed to have caused her death.\nThe punishment for such cases is imprisonment for not less than 7 years but may be extended to ife imprisonment.\nOption A: Section 63 (IPC 375) deals with rape.\nOption C: Section 72 (IPC 228A) deals with imprisonment for up to 2 years and a fine for disclosure of the identity of a rape victim.\nOption D: Section 100 (IPC 299) deals with culpable homicide.\nSolution to Question 18:\nAdultery is not liable for criminal prosecution.\nSection 497 of the Indian Penal Code dealing with adultery was invalidated (struck down as unconstitutional being violative of articles 14 and 21) by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India on 27th September 2018. However, there might be civil liabilities including ground for divorce and dissolution of marriage.\nHowever, BNS retains Section 498 of the IPC as BNS Section 84 which penalizes a man for enticing the wife of another man so that she may have intercourse with any person.\nOption A: BNS 318(4)/IPC 420 deals with cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.\nOption B: BNS 75/IPC 354A deals with sexual harassment and punishment of sexual harassment. Consensual sexual intercourse is not included in this.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe husband can be booked under Section 108 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (306 of the Indian Penal Code), which deals with the abetment of suicide.\nThe Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India on 27th September 2018 struck down IPC 497 dealing with adultery as unconstitutional. However, the court noted that if any aggrieved spouse commits suicide because of the life partner's adulterous relation then, if the evidence produced, it could be treated as an abetment to suicide.\nConsensual sexual intercourse between adults of same-sex no longer comes under the purview of section 377 of IPC (as per the judgment of the Hon\u2019ble Supreme court on 6th September 2018).\nHence, there are no sections corresponding to IPC 497 and 377 in the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita\n(BNS).\nSolution to Question 20:\nBSA (Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinyam) Section 39(1) [I\u2021A 45] gives information regarding \u2021xpert witnesses.\nThe important Sections under BSA (Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinyam) include:\nBSA secti on\nI\u2021A Secti on\nProvision for",

To prove negligence, all the following four elements must be present:\nDuty - A duty of care by the doctor must exist.\nDereliction - The physician must maintain the standard of a 'prudent physician' under similar circumstances. If the physician fails to maintain the standard of care, it is called dereliction.\nDirect causation - The negligent act or omission must directly cause the injury without any intervening cause.\nDamage - The negligent act must cause damage of a type that would have been foreseen by a reasonable physician.\nDeath and Post-Mortem Changes\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is Casper's dictum related to?\nIdentification of body\nEstablishing the cause of death\nEstimation of time since death\nEstablishing weapon of injury\nQuestion 2:\nYou are declaring a patient brain dead by using Harvard criteria.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nCasper dictum is used in the estimation of time since death.\nIt states that, one week of putrefaction in the air is equivalent to two weeks in water, which is quivalent to eight weeks buried in soil, given the same environmental temperature.\nNote: Forensic taphonomy is the study and interpretation of postmortem processes of human remains i.e. the history of a body following death.\nSolution to Question 2:\nIsoelectric EEG is included in Harvard criteria for brain death and not ECG. Harvard criteria for brain death include:\nUnreceptivity and unresponsiveness\nNo movements\nApnoea\nAbsence of elicitable reflexes\nIsoelectric EEG (confirmatory)\nAll these tests should be recorded. If there is no change after 24 hours, then the patient is declared brain dead.\nPhiladelphia protocol, Minnesota criteria are other criteria used to diagnose brain death.\nSolution to Question 3:\nSuspended animation is not seen in throttling (manual strangulation).\nSuspended animation is a condition where signs of life are absent as functions are interrupted for some time or are reduced to a minimum.\nIt is seen in the following conditions:\nVagal inhibition\nSevere syncopal attacks\nNarcotic poisoning\nShock\nCerebral concussion\nInsanity\nNewborn infants\nDrowning\nHypothermia\nElectrocution\nSunstrok\nCholera\nAfter anesthesia\nSolution to Question 4:\nVictims of smoke inhalation are affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. In carbon monoxide poisoning, the cause of death is anemic hypoxia.\nCarbon monoxide has a higher affinity to hemoglobin compared to oxygen and hence the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It displaces oxygen from its combination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. It thus reduces the oxygen content of the blood, and hence, that of the tissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to anemic anoxia.\nIt is important to note that in the case of anemic hypoxia, O2 content is low but dissolved O2 is within normal limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors.\nNote: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes both anemic (due to CO-Hb) and histotoxic (due to inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to anemic hypoxia.\nOption A - Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent.\nOption B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.\nSolution to Question 5:\nRigor mortis is an early sign of death. Immediate signs of death (somatic death):\nInsensibility and loss of voluntary power\nCessation of respiration\nCessation of circulation\nEarly signs of death (cellular death):\nPallor and loss of elasticity of the skin\nEye changes\nPrimary flaccidity of muscles\nCooling of the body\nPostmortem lividity/suggilation\nRigor mortis\nLate signs of death:\nPutrefaction\nAdipocer\nMummification\nSolution to Question 6:\nWinslow\u2019s test is used to check the cessation of respiration. In this test a bowl of water is kept on the chest and movement on the surface of the water is noted.\nTests for confirming cessation of circulation:\nNo audible heart sounds on continuous auscultation on the precordial area of the chest for a minimum of 5 minutes and a flat ECG recording for 5 minutes\nMagnus\u2019s test (Ligature test) - Fingers fail to show congestion distal to a ligature applied at their bas\nDiaphanous test (Transillumination test) - Failure to show redness in the webspace between th fingers on transillumination from behind\nIcard\u2019s test - Fluorescent dye on being injected at a given site in a dead body fails to produce any discoloration\nFingernail test - No blanching and filling of blood in the fingernail on the application of pressur and releas\nTests for confirming cessation of breathing:\nNo audible breath sounds on continuous auscultation of the upper part of the chest and in front of or on the larynx for a minimum of 5 minutes\nFeather test \u2013 No movement of a feather held in front of the nos\nMirror test \u2013 Mirror held in front of the nose does not turn dim due to any moisture of breath\nWinslow\u2019s test \u2013 No movement of the surface of the water in a bowl kept on the chest\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe Kevorkian sign is a postmortem change that occurs in the retinal vessels. It lasts for about 1 hour.\nIt is characterized by fragmentation of the blood column in the retinal vessels. It appears within minutes after death and lasts for about 1 hour. It can be visualized by using an ophthalmoscope as shown below.\n\nOther postmortem changes occurring in the eye:\nCornea - dull, hazy, opaque, wrinkled\nFlaccidity of eyeballs occurs due to falling in intraocular pressure. IOP reaches zero at the end of 2 hours after death\nTache Noir: A film of cell debris and mucus forms two yellow triangles on the sclera on either side of the cornea, with base towards the margin of cornea and apex towards medial or lateral canthus of the eye. It appears within 3-4 hours of death\nIncrease in potassium concentration in vitreous - linear increase up to 100 hours following death. It is helpful in determining the time since death\nSolution to Question 8:\nZasko\u2019s phenomenon/ tendon reaction is related to muscular changes following death.\nIt is elicited in the quadriceps femoris muscle. Striking the lower third of the muscle about 10 cms above the patella with a reflex hammer causes upward movement of the patella due to contraction of the muscle. It can be seen 1 to 2 hours after death.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe phenomenon of cooling of the body following a death is called algor mortis/ postmortem cooling.\nAfter death, the body loses heat mainly by conduction and convection. It is one of the early changes occurring after death. Temperature is usually measured in the rectum or abdominal cavity (subhepatic region).\nSolution to Question 10:\nCholera, septicemia, and sunstroke lead to an increase in body temperature in the first two hours following death.\nPostmortem caloricity is the condition in which the temperature of the body remains raised for about the first two hours after death.\nIt occurs:\nWhen the regulation of body temperature has been severely disturbed before death as in sunstroke, pontine hemorrhag\nIncreased heat production in muscles due to convulsions as in tetanus and strychnine poisoning\nWhen there has been increased bacterial activity as in septicemia, cholera\nSolution to Question 11:\nEdema decreases the rate of postmortem cooling. Factors increasing the rate of postmortem cooling:\nThe greater difference in the temperature between the body and the atmospher\nLarge body surface area\nChildren and old aged peopl\nHigher humidity and rapid air velocity\nA body immersed in running water Rate of cooling is decreased in:\nExcess fat\nEdema\nBody covered with clothing\nBodies in small, ill-ventilated room\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image shows suggilation.\nPostmortem lividity (suggilation/ postmortem hypostasis/ postmortem staining/ livor mortis/ vibices) develops in the dependent portions of the body due to engorged vessels showing through the skin.\nSolution to Question 13:\nFixation of hypostasis occurs 6 \u2013 12 hours after death.\nPurple or reddish-purple discoloration of the skin due to collection of blood in toneless capillaries in dependant parts of the body. It is called postmortem hypostasis/ postmortem staining/ postmortem lividity/ livor mortis/ suggilation/ vibices.\nTiming of development of postmortem hypostasis:\nMottled patches \u2013 1-3 hours following the death\nUniform area of staining \u2013 3-6 hours following death\nFully developed and fixation of hypostasis \u2013 6-12 hours\nSolution to Question 14:\nGlove and stocking hypostasis indicates postmortem staining of legs, feet, hands, and forearm. This occurs in the vertical suspension of the body as in hanging where these parts form the dependant parts.\nSites of postmortem hypostasis depending on the position of the body:\nPosition of the body\nSites of hypostasis\nSupine\nBack except for shoulder blad s, buttocks, and calves (cont act pallor)\nVertical as in hanging\nLegs, feet, forearm, and hand s (glove and stock hypostasis)\nDrowning\nFace, the upper part of chest, hands, lower arms\nInverted like in drunken pers ons\nHead and neck\nSolution to Question 15:\nIn the given image, margins are irregular and staining is not uniform. There is no area of contact pallor in the region of shoulder blades. This is indicative of a bruise.\nThe difference between a bruise and postmortem lividity is given below:\nFeatures\nBruis\nPostmortem lividity\nCause\nRuptured vessels (either supe rficial or deep)\nEngorged vessels showing thr ough the skin\nLocation\nAt the site of blunt trauma\nOn dependent parts\nFeatures\tBruis\tPostmortem lividity\nFeatures\tBruis\tPostmortem lividity\nFeatures\tBruis\tPostmortem lividity\nMargins\nIrregular\nClearly defined\nSwelling and abrasio n\nPresent\nAbsent\nContact pallor\nAbsent\nPresent on shoulder blades\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe color of postmortem staining in carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is cherry red.\nSolution to Question 17:\nPugilistic attitude/ heat stiffening is due to coagulation of muscle proteins.\nIt is a condition simulating rigor mortis. It occurs when the body is exposed to temperatures above 65\u00b0C like in deaths from burning, high voltage electric shock, or from falling into hot liquid.\nThe mechanism is the coagulation of muscle protein. The flexors, being bulkier than the extensors, contract more and force the limbs into a position of general flexion, the so-called boxer's or pugilistic attitude. It could be due to antemortem or postmortem burns, especially if the body is burnt, charred and black.\nOther conditions simulating rigor mortis are \u2013 cold stiffening, gas stiffening, cadaveric spasm/cataleptic rigidity.\nSolution to Question 18:\nNysten's rule describes the sequential onset of rigor mortis in the various muscle groups.\nRigor mortis (cadaveric rigidity or death stiffening) refers to the stiffening and shortening of muscles following death. The basic sequence of the rigor mortis begins from the head and continues downwards the body. It disappears in the same order of appearance.\nThe muscles are affected in the given order:\nInvoluntary muscles - Heart (left chamber of the heart is affected first)\nEyelids\nNeck and lower jaw\nFac\nChest\nUpper extremities\nAbdomen\nLegs\nFingers and toes\nSolution to Question 19:\nCadaveric rigidity is also known as rigor mortis. It is due to the depletion of ATP and indicates time since death. Muscle stiffening is not marked and can be overcome by moderate force. The rigor starts occurring 1-2 hours after death (postmortem nature) and muscles do not respond to electrical stimuli.\nCadaveric spasm / instantaneous rigor/ cataleptic rigidity/ death clutch is a phenomenon where a group of muscles in a state of contraction at the time of death remains contracted after death until molecular death occurs.\nCadaveric spasm is an antemortem phenomenon and occurs immediately after death. There is no stage of primary relaxation. It is seen in cases of deaths coupled with emotional disturbances like:\nIn cases of excitement, fear, severe pain\nExhaustion at the time of death\nCerebral hemorrhag\nInjury to the nervous system\nDrowning\nStrychnine poisoning Examples:\nIn case of drowning, weeds and grass caught in hand during struggle remain firmly grasped even after death. This indicates that the person was alive when entering the water\nIn case of suicides, weapons remain firmly grasped in the hand\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe given picture shows postmortem marbling. It starts in 24 hours and becomes prominent in 36-48 hours.\nThe blood in the vessels is haemolysed, which stains the vessel walls and the adjacent tissues, giving rise to a marbled appearance. It is greenish-brown or purplish-red discoloration of superficial veins due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin which diffuses into tissues. It is distinctly appreciable on the abdomen, shoulders, chest, and inguinal region.\nSolution to Question 21:\nAutolysis is the self-digestion of tissues by lysosomes and their digestive enzymes (mainly hydrolases).\nThe earliest autolytic changes occur in parenchymatous (brain) and glandular tissues. The earliest external sign is the whitish, cloudy appearance of the cornea. It is a sterile process i.e. bacteria are not involved.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe first external sign of putrefaction is the greenish discoloration of the skin over the region of the caecum.\nThe disintegration of body tissues is known as putrefaction. It is one of the late signs of death.\nEnzyme lecithinase produced by Clostridium welchii plays an important role in putrefaction. Sulphmethaglobin is the agent imparting greenish color.\nThe earliest internal change is reddish-brown discoloration of the inner surface of vessels, especially of the aorta.\nSolution to Question 23:\nAmong the given options, the first organ to putrefy is the larynx and the last to putrefy is a non-gravid uterus.\nThe decreasing order of organ putrefaction (from first to last):\nLarynx and trachea\nStomach, intestine, spleen\nLiver and lungs\nBrain\nHeart\nKidney and the bladder\nProstate and uterus \u2013 non-gravid uterus resists putrefaction whereas the gravid uterus and uterus soon after delivery putrefies rapidly\nSkin, muscle, tendons\nBones\nSolution to Question 24:\nHoneycombing of the liver is a sign of putrefaction.\nIn putrefaction, Clostridium welchii produces small clumps in tissue space and produce gas. This tends to increase the size of the liver and it becomes soft and studded with blisters. As bubbles develop in the liver, the organ develops a honeycombed vesicular and foamy appearance.\nSolution to Question 25:\nPutrefaction is delayed in carbolic acid poisoning.\nPutrefaction is the fifth stage, following pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis in the decomposition of dead bodies.\nIt is the decomposition of proteins, the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs.\nIn the matter of death by poisoning, the putrefaction of the body is chemically delayed by poisons. Death by poisons such as carbon monoxide, potassium cyanide, carbolic acid, barbiturates, fluoride, phosphorous, endrin, datura, strychnine, yellow oleander, nicotine, arsenic, mercury, copper, antimony, lead, thallium, chronic alcoholism can resist or delay putrefaction.\nDeath by septic diseases, puerperal sepsis, kidney diseases with generalized edema can hasten putrefaction.\nOption A: It is a case of salicylic acid poisoning. Option B: It is a case of aconite poisoning.\nOption D: It is a case of organophosphate poisoning.\nSolution to Question 26:\nIf a cadaver is recovered in a state of putrefaction and is infested with maggots, the time since death is likely to be 1 to 2 days.\nThe rationale of forensic entomology is that after death, invasion of an unprotected body by sarcosaprophagous (feeding on dead and decay) insects comes in successive waves.\nDifferent arthropods colonize the body after death and some species pass through complex life cycles. They can be used to determine at least the minimum time since death by studying the stage of the life cycle of the insects.\nEstimated time of death according to fly lifecycle (in summers):\nMaggots - 1 to 2 days\nPupae - 3 to 6 days\nAdult flies - 6-7 days\nIn winters, the life cycle can be of 8-20 days.\nSolution to Question 27:\nWhen the process involves the face, the features are well preserved, which helps to establish the identity.\nAdipocere is a modification of putrefaction. In this, the fatty tissues of the body change into a substance known as adipocere. The change is due to the gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of fats forming insoluble soaps. These soaps are acidic, which prevents the growth of putrefactive bacteria.\nAdipocere has a distinct offensive or sweetish smell, but during the early stages of its production, a penetrating ammoniacal odor is also noticed. A warm, moist, anaerobic environment favors adipocere formation e.g., bodies immersed in water.\nSolution to Question 28:\nThe absence of moisture in the air and the continuous action of dry or warmed air are necessary for the process of mummification.\nMummification is the process of dehydration or drying and shriveling of the cadaver that occurs from the evaporation of water. The natural appearances of the body and general facial features are preserved.\nSolution to Question 29:\nThe mummified body is odorless.\nMedico Legal Autopsy\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following best describes the legal term corpus delicti?\nMedico legal autopsy\nThe body of offence\nCriminal negligence\nExhumation\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following statements is false regarding medico-legal autopsy?\nConsent from relatives is required\nLegal permission is necessary\nMagistrate is the authorizing officer in case of exhumation\nIn India, all registered medical practitioners can perform an autopsy\nQuestion 3:\nAn autopsy may be performed at the site of recovery of the body in all of the following cases except?\nPutrefied body\nExhumation\nDistrict Magistrate orders\nDeaths due to RTA\nQuestion 4:\nThe police hands over the body of a person who died due to hanging to you for an autopsy. Which of the following incisions is preferred in this case?\nI shaped incision\nModified Y shaped incision\nY shaped incision\nInverted Y shaped incision\nQuestion 5:\nYou observe a forensic surgeon doing en masse removal of organs during an autopsy.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nCorpus delicti, also known as the body of offense, says that a crime must be proved to have occurred before a person can be convicted of committing that crime.\nThe main part of corpus delicti is the establishment of the identity of the dead body and infliction of violence in a particular way, at a particular time and place, by the person or persons charged with a crime and none other.\nA conviction for an offense does not necessarily depend upon the corpus delicti if there are eyewitnesses or strong corroborative evidence.\nIn a charge of homicide, it includes:\nPositive identification of the dead body (victim)\nProof of its death by a criminal act of the accused\nSolution to Question 2:\nIn the case of a medicolegal autopsy, consent of the relatives is not required. For conducting a medicolegal autopsy:\nLegal authorization is a must\nMagistrate is the authorizing officer in case of exhumation\nPreferably, a forensic pathologist or medicolegal expert does the autopsy. However, in India, due to the lack of adequate qualified experts, all registered medical practitioners can perform this with authorization by the state.\nNote: Clinical/ pathological autopsy requires consent from the relatives of the deceased.\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn deaths due to RTA, autopsy is usually performed in an equipped mortuary. An autopsy may be performed at the site of recovery of the body, in the following scenarios:\nAdvanced stage of putrefaction as materials of evidentiary value may be lost during transportation\nExhumation\nIf the District Magistrate desires it to be conducted at the site due to some law and order problems\nAn autopsy is preferably performed in an equipped mortuary.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe incision preferred in the case of asphyxial death due to neck compression (as in hanging) is the modified Y-shaped incision.\nIn strangulation, hanging, and any condition where the larynx might be damaged, a modified\nY-shaped incision is to be preferred. This incision is used because the skin of the upper neck can then be dissected off the mandible and raised to give a wide approach to the neck structures.\nGiven below are types of incisions done for an autopsy:\nY-Shaped Incision: Commences at the acromial process on the shoulder on either side. It runs downwards and anteriorly beneath the breasts as to meet at the xiphisternum in the midline. It then runs downwards as in an I-shaped incision to the symphysis pubis. It is preferred in females. It is more cosmetically accepted as the incision and the stitches are minimally seen after the autopsy.\n\nModified Y-shaped incision: Commences at the angle of mandible on either side, brought forwards and downwards to meet at the suprasternal notch. It is then run downwards as a midline incision up to the pubic symphysis. Indicated in cases of strangulation or death due to compression of the neck.\n\nI-Shaped Incision: Extends from symphysis mentii to symphysis pubis taking curve towards left around the umbilicus. It is used routinely in practice. It is simple and convenient.\n\nElongated X-shaped Incision: This is a special incision used to dissect out subcutaneous structures in the back to identify and evaluate the extent of blunt injuries, which are usually missed where superficial imprints are faint, particularly when present on skin not overlying bone. This is helpful in the reconstruction of events prior to death and should be practiced in cases of custodial death.\n\nInverted Y-shaped incision is used in infants.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe en masse removal of organs is done in the Letulle technique.\nIt is the removal of the cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic organs as a single organ mass. They are subsequently dissected into organ blocks.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe correct match is:\nNegative autopsy: An autopsy in which, the cause of death remains unknown, even after all laboratory examinations including biochemical, microbiological, virological, microscopic, and toxicological examination.\nObscure autopsy: An autopsy done meticulously, but presents with no clear-cut findings as to give a definite cause of death. Further lab investigations are required to know the details of the cause of death in this type of autopsy.\nColumn A\nColumn B\nNegative autop sy\nCause of death remains unkn own even after detailed labo ratory investigations\nObscure autop sy\nNo definite cause of death aft er an autopsy, further evaluat ion is needed\nVirtual autops y\nCause of death is assessed by non-invasive methods\nClinical autops y\nDone for academic purpose\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn Breslau\u2019s second life test, also known as the stomach bowel test, the stomach and the duodenum are tested.\nThis test is done to determine whether the baby was born alive or not.\nIt works on the principle that some air is swallowed during respiration in a live-born child. Detecting the presence of this air in these viscera constitutes the basis for this test.\nProcedure :\nThe stomach and duodenum are removed separately and placed in water. If they float, make a small cut while underwater to see air bubbles coming up. A floating viscera giving out air bubbles when opened underwater is a positive test.\nInterpretation:\nA positive test proves live birth even in the absence of a positive hydrostatic lung test. This may happen if there had been some obstruction in the respiratory passages.\nA negative test does not mean stillbirth since air does not necessarily enter the stomach in adequate amounts during the breathing act.\nPutrefaction invalidates the result.\nNote: Breslau\u2019s first life test is when the same test is performed on the lungs. Also known as Hydrostatic test/ Floatation test / Raygat\u2019s test.\nSolution to Question 8:\nIn Raygat's test, an unrespired lung (stillbirth) may float due to gases of decomposition, as seen in putrefaction.\nIt is also known as the floatation test/ Breslau\u2019s first life test/ hydrostatic test. It is done to determine whether the newborn has respired or not:\nIf the lung pieces float in water, it means that respiration has taken place, indicating a live birth\nIf the pieces sink, respiration has not taken place, signifies stillborn\nA respired lung (live birth) may sink in water in the following conditions:\nLung edema\nLung collapse\nPneumonia (consolidation)\nCongenital syphilis\nOther tests to determine if respiration has taken place or not are:\nFodere\u2019s test: Weight of lungs before respiration - 30-40g, after respiration - 60-66g\nPloucquet\u2019s test: Weight of lungs before respiration - 1/70 of body weight, after respiration - 1/35 of body weight\nWredin\u2019s test: Assesses the changes in the middle ear. The gelatinous substance in the middle ear is replaced by air if respiration has taken place.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe absence (and not presence) of meconium in the large bowel is a confirmatory sign of live birth.\nConfirmatory signs of live birth:\nPresence of milk in the stomach\nAbsence of meconium in the large bowel, exception being breech delivery.\nExfoliation of skin\nClosure of fetal channels\nChanges in the umbilical cord Live birth can be excluded if :\nSigns of maceration are present\nSigns of immaturity are present. If the child has not attained the viable age (7 months), it could not have been born alive.\nSolution to Question 10:\nA second autopsy may be performed when relatives are not satisfied, new circumstances emerge, or investigating officer demands it.\nAfter an autopsy, when a repeat medicolegal postmortem is performed with the authorization by law it is called a second autopsy.\nThe magistrate/commissioner of the police vested with such power, orders the second autopsy. A second autopsy may be performed in the following cases:\nThe relatives of the deceased are not satisfied with the first autopsy report and they have pointed out certain lapses in the first autopsy.\nThe first autopsy was not performed in the light of the circumstances which are now available.\nThe investigating authority demands a second autopsy for setting the investigation on the right track.\nSolution to Question 11:\nArsenic can be detected even in conflagrated human bones. Hence, it is possible to detect poisoning by arsenic even when the body has been burnt for a long time.\nArsenic is volatile but much of the arsenic in bones is converted into arsenates, which are non-volatile.\nIn suspected cases of poisoning by arsenic, all the available ashes and burnt bones should be preserved for chemical analysis.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given case is of a suspected anaphylactic death in which tryptase is of diagnostic value.\nThe postmortem diagnosis of anaphylaxis remains difficult due to the lack of specific biomarkers. Mast cell tryptase (MCT) / tryptase is a sensitive measure of mast cell activation, and\nhigh levels will be found after severe anaphylactic reactions, especially those causing severe shock.\nDiagnostic tests for suspected anaphylactic deaths are serum tryptase and radio-allergosorbent testing (RAST for IgE).\nMechanical Injuries\nQuestion 1:\nIdentify the injury in the image below.\n\nAbrasion\nLaceration\nBruise\nImprint\nQuestion 2:\nAn abrasion involves which of the following layers of the skin?\nPartial thickness of epidermis\nFull thickness of epidermis\nEpidermis + superficial dermis\nEpidermis + dermis\nQuestion 3:\nIn an abrasion caused by tangential force, which of the following indicates the direction of said force?\nFishtailing of the wound\nEpidermal tags\nTailing of the wound\nCrushed hair follicles\nQuestion 4:\nAbrasions are noted on the body of a person who was found dead at his home. Which of the following indicates that these might be produced after death?\nVital reaction positive\nCongestion seen\nPresent over bony prominences\nBright reddish brown in color\nQuestion 5:\nWhich of the following statements is falsely matched?\nAntemortem wound - positive vital reaction\nAntemortem wound - negative vital reaction\nPostmortem wound - negative vital reaction\nPostmortem wound - no vital reaction\nQuestion 6:\nWhich of the following statements regarding a bruise is false?\nThey lie underneath an intact epidermis\nThey are caused due to capillary bleeding\nBlood commonly collects in the subcutaneous layer\nIt may become visible 1-2 days after the traumatic incident\nQuestion 7:\nWhich of the following sites is more prone to bruising with blunt trauma?\nShins\nAbdomen\nButtocks\nArms\nQuestion 8:\nT e police brought a victim of alleged domestic violence with a big bruise for evaluation. She claimed that it was inflicted by her husband three days ago after which he had gone out of town. Which of the following is correct while determining the age of this injury?\nHistological examination is the most reliable method\nThe appearance of green colour is the most significant change\nPerl's reaction is the most useful criterion\nBright yellow colour indicates that it is less than 18 hours old\nQuestion 9:\nA bruise on the upper arm of an alleged victim of the assault has the following appearance. What is the age of the injury based on colour of this bruise?\n",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nT e given image shows an abrasion.\nAn abrasion is the most superficial of injuries. It does not penetrate the full thickness of the epidermis.\nA pure abrasion does not bleed, as blood vessels are confined to the dermis. However, the dermal papillae are corrugated in nature. Thus, many abrasions enter the dermis and bleeding commonly occurs.\nSolution to Question 2:\nAn abrasion is the most superficial of injuries and is one that does not penetrate the full thickness of the epidermis.\nT us the pure abrasion does not bleed, as blood vessels are confined to the dermis. The dermal papillae are corrugated in nature. Therefore, many abrasions enter the dermis, and bleeding commonly occurs.\nAbrasions are commonly known as grazes or scratches.\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn an abrasion caused by a tangential force, the direction of the force is determined by epidermal tags.\nAbrasions caused by a tangential force are known as 'brush abrasion' or 'grazes' or 'brush burn.' It is commonly seen when a body is dragged over a rough surface, such as a road. This scrapes linear\nfurrows across the skin. The epidermal tags raised by the impact tend to pile up at the distal end. T e method of formation of epidermal tags is given in the image below.\n\nOption A: Fishtailing is the shape of the stab wound caused by a single-edged weapon. Option C: Tailing of the wound indicates the direction of injury in incised wounds.\nOption D: Crushed hair follicles are seen at the edge of the wound in a laceration.\nSolution to Question 4:\nAbrasions present over bony prominences indicate that they might be produced after death. Antemortem abrasions may be located anywhere.\nDifference between antemortem and postmortem wounds:\nTrait\nAntemortem wounds\nPostmortem wounds\nSite\nAnywhere on the body\nUsually over bony prominenc es\nColour\nBright reddish brown\nYellowish, translucent, Parch ment like\nExudatio n\nMore\nLess\nMicrosco pic\nIntravital reaction and conge stion seen\nNo intravital reaction and co ngestion\nSolution to Question 5:\nPostmortem wounds show no/absent vital reaction because no enzyme activity will be found in a wound sustained after death. This is not the same as a negative vital reaction as it is indicative of decreased enzymatic activity and is seen in antemortem wounds.\nVital reactions are local tissue reactions at the site of tissue damage. Only antemortem wounds show vital reactions as cells are active at the time of wound infliction. The vital reactions of an antemortem wound are of two zones:\nNegative vital reaction (decrease in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs in the central necrotic area, close to the edge of the wound where there is irreversible damage to tissues.\nPositive vital reaction (increase in enzymatic activity of wound): It occurs just outside the necrotic area of the wound in order to salvage damaged (but not irreversibly damaged) tissues.\nDifference between antemortem and postmortem wounds:\nTrait\nAntemortem wounds\nPostmortem wounds\nSite\nAnywhere on the body\nUsually over bony prominenc es\nColour\nBright reddish brown\nYellowish, translucent, Parch ment like\nExudatio n\nMore\nLess\nMicrosco pic\nIntravital reaction and conge stion seen\nNo intravital reaction and co ngestion\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nContusions/bruises are caused by damage to veins, venules and small arteries. Capillary bleeding would not be visible to the naked eye.\nA pure bruise lies beneath an intact epidermis. There is an extravascular collection of blood that has leaked from blood vessels damaged by mechanical impact.\nT e usual bruise from a blunt impact is situated in the subcutaneous tissues, often in the fat layer. Obese people tend to bruise more easily due to the greater volume of subcutaneous tissue.\nDelayed bruising refers to bruises that become more prominent with the passage of hours or days. T is is caused by the percolation of blood from deeper tissues upwards towards the epidermis. It is also partly due to continued bleeding from the ruptured vessels.\nSolution to Question 7:\nT e shins are particularly prone to bruising with blunt trauma.\nResilient areas, such as the abdominal wall and buttocks, bruise less with a given impact. The head, chest, and shins are more prone to bruising. This is because these regions have underlying bone and less subcutaneous tissue.\nSolution to Question 8:\nT e most useful criterion for dating a bruise is Perl's reaction for detecting haemosiderin. It becomes positive about 24\u201390 hours after infliction. Sometimes, there can be an earlier appearance, even down to 12 hours.\nColor changes in a bruise cannot be reliably used to estimate the age of a bruise. The most significant change is the appearance of a yellow color. This indicates that the bruise is more than 18 hours old.\nHistological examination is unreliable in the accurate dating of bruises.\nSolution to Question 9:\nT e bruise in the given image has a yellow appearance which is attributed to the presence of bilirubin. This finding makes the bruise about 7-12 days old.\nBruises are mechanical injuries that are characterized by the extravasation of blood into subcutaneous or subepithelial tissue spaces. The continuity of the overlying skin is preserved. T ese injuries are typical consequences of blunt force trauma.\nT e extravasated blood serves as a sign of inflammation to attract macrophages, which degrade the hemoglobin into various compounds (hemosiderin, haematoidin, and bilirubin). This gives rise to shifting color changes that begin at the wound's periphery and migrate towards the center as time goes on.\nSolution to Question 10:\nBruising at the nape of the neck does not indicate a fracture of the posterior cranial fossa.\nEctopic bruises are also called migratory/percolated bruising. They are found at a different location than the actual site of injury. They are caused by the percolation of blood in the subcutaneous tissue from one site to another.\nExamples are:\nBlack eye - due to actual trauma to the eye, or maybe an ectopic bruise. It may be from trauma to the forehead or from a fracture of the anterior cranial fossa.\nT e image below shows a black eye.\n\nBattle sign - bruising seen over the mastoid process. It is from a fracture of the middle cranial fossa.\nT e image given below shows battle sign.\n\nBruising on the neck may indicate a jaw fracture.\nSolution to Question 11:\nT e given image shows postmortem hypostasis. The classic test used to differentiate a bruise from ypostasis is the incision test.\nT e suspected area is incised to see if the underlying blood is intravascular (hypostasis) or infiltrating the tissues outside the vessels (contusion).\nOption A: Gettler's chloride test is used to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning. It is not widely used now.\nOption C: In the precipitin test, a specific antiserum is made to react with the seminal fluid, blood, or saliva. A positive test will confirm human origin.\nOption D: Breslau's second life test is done to determine whether a child was born alive or not.\nSolution to Question 12:\nT e image shows 'tram-line' bruising. It would have most likely been produced by a stick or an iron rod.\nIt occurs when the skin surface is struck by a rod or rectangular sectioned object. The weapon sinks into the skin on impact. This causes the edges to drag the skin downwards and the traction, tears the marginal blood vessels. The centre compresses the skin. This causes little or no damage to the vessels in the absence of underlying bone.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nT e tissue most resistant to knife penetration is the skin, apart from bone or calcified cartilage.\nWhen a knife-point impacts against the skin, the latter dimples, and resists. The tension developed in the stretched skin appears to act as an elastic reservoir and when the threshold of resistance is exceeded, penetration suddenly occurs.\nMuscle offers little resistance to penetration. Uncalcified cartilage and subcutaneous tissue are easily penetrated by a sharp knife.\nSolution to Question 14:\nA wedge-shaped wound is produced by a single-edged knife. A double-edged knife produces an elliptical wound.\nT e image given below shows the types of wounds produced by different weapons:\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nIf the wound is parallel to the langer lines, it would appear normal. In contrast to a wound that is perpendicular to the Langer lines, which would be longer than normal. This is because such wounds tend to gape more, giving a false interpretation of the weapon.\nOption A: The taper of the blade is related to wound size. The length of the wound would be equal to the width of the blade at the point to which it was inserted. Thus the length of the wound varies according to the depth to which it was inserted. Once the blade edges become parallel, the wound size remains constant for further penetration of the knife.\nOption B: If a knife is driven up to the hilt, the depth of the wound as measured at autopsy may be greater than the true length of the blade. This is usually seen in the abdomen, and to a lesser extent in the chest. A forceful stab can cause the abdominal or chest wall to indent, allowing the knife tip to reach tissues that would normally be beyond its reach.\n\nOption C: If the weapon is moved after insertion, it distorts wound characteristics.\nSolution to Question 16:\nScalping is a type of laceration. Here, a large area of skin and subcutaneous tissue is rolled off the scalp.\nT ese lesions could be caused by the traction of hair being trapped in machinery. This was formerly a common industrial accident. 'Hairnets' were worn by women factory workers to prevent this.\nFlaying is also a type of laceration, caused by shearing force. This is where a large area of skin and subcutaneous tissue is rolled off a limb.\nSolution to Question 17:\nSharp linear injury in the underlying bone suggests an incised wound, rather than a split laceration.\nAn incised wound is a clean-cut wound caused by a sharp-cutting instrument.\nA split laceration is a type of laceration that usually occurs in areas where the skin overlies bone. An example of such an area is the scalp. Split lacerations can resemble incised wounds.\nA laceration can be distinguished from an incised wound by:\nBruising and crushing of the margins\nPersistence of tissue strands across the interior of the wound, including fascial bands, vessels, and nerves\nAbsence of a sharply linear injury in the underlying bone\nIn areas covered by hair, as on the scalp, intact hairs will cross the wound T e image given below shows an incised wound.\n\nT e image given below shows a lacerated wound.\n\nNote: Lacerations are also commonly known as cuts or tears.\nSolution to Question 18:\nTearing at the ends of a laceration are called swallow-tails. These are seen at angles diverging from the main laceration itself.\nT e image below shows swallow-tails in a lacerated wound.\n\nOption A: Sparrow's foot marks are seen in windshield injuries in car accidents. Option B: Wedge-shaped injuries are seen in stabbing with a single-edged weapon.\nOption C: Fish-tails: These may be seen in stab wounds where the skin splits at the corner. T e image below shows fish-tail in a stab wound.\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nIn the given scenario, multiple linear incised wounds on the inner side (ulnar border) of the forearm are most likely to be defence wounds.\nT ey are sustained when a victim is trying to protect himself from attacks (homicide). The attack may be by fists, feet, and blunt or sharp instruments.\nIn case of a blunt instrument, fist or feet:\nBruises are most common along with abrasions\nCommonly on the extensor and ulnar aspect of the forearms, wrists, back of the hand, and knuckles\nMay be seen on thighs due to an attempt to protect genitals In the case of a sharp instrument:\nSeen on the ulnar side of the forearm, wrist, hand, and fingers\nCuts on the flexures of phalanges occur if the victim tries to seize the weapon Firearm injury:\nArms may be used to shield the trunk or head from the blast\nAn entrance and an exit wound in the upper arm may be seen\nThe missile may then re-penetrate the trunk\nOptions C and D: Tentative cuts or hesitation wounds are self-inflicted wounds made while attempting to commit suicide.They are usually on the radial side of the forearm.\nSolution to Question 20:\nLeucocyte infiltration in wounds is seen at 4-12 hours. Histological changes in wounds\nTime after injury\nHistological changes",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most common type of intracranial lesion following trauma is cerebral contusion.\nA contusion is an effusion of blood into the tissues, due to the rupture of blood vessels caused by blunt trauma. A contusion evolves to form an intracerebral hematoma over hours or days.\nThe most common type of intracranial hemorrhage following trauma is a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nNote: Trauma is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage, followed by an aneurysm.\nSolution to Question 2:\nContusions may occur in the superficial fascia, in the temporalis muscle, in the loose areolar tissue between galea aponeurotica and the pericranium. They are better felt than seen. Multiple contusions of the scalp may join together and it is often difficult to determine the number of blows inflicted.\nThe bruises of the scalp are associated with prominent edema. Subgaleal hematoma remains the same color till it resolves.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given image shows a gutter fracture of the skull as part of the outer table is missing.\nGutter fractures form a furrow in the outer table of the skull, usually as a result of a glancing blow by a missile from a rifled firearm. They may also be associated with comminuted depressed fractures of inner table of the skull.\nSolution to Question 4:\nIn the given scenario, ring fracture is most likely to have caused the fatal injury. These are the most common fractures that occur due to a fall from height.\nThese occur in the posterior fossa around the foramen magnum. If the kinetic energy of the fall is not absorbed by fractures of the legs, pelvis, or spine, the impact is transmitted up the cervical spine. This force may be rammed into the skull, carrying a circle of occipital bone with it.\nThe image given below shows the fracture line of a ring fracture.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given image shows multiple fracture lines dividing the skull into fragments. Hence, it is a mosaic fracture/ spider-web fracture of the skull.\nIt is a comminuted depressed fracture that also has fissures radiating from it, forming a\nspider\u2019s-web or mosaic pattern. These fractures are formed due to a significant force striking over a broad area.\nThe below image shows a spider-web fracture of the skull.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe image shows hinge fracture/ motorcyclists fracture. Here, the base of the skull is divided into 2 halves, each moving independently of the other like a hinge.\nSolution to Question 7:\nAt the point of contact of the weapon (hammer) with the skull, the inner table is likely to fracture.\nWhen the skull receives a focal impact there is a momentary distortion of the shape of the cranium. The area under the point of impact bends inwards. As the contents of the skull are virtually incompressible, there must consequently be a compensatory distortion or bulging of other areas. This is the struck hoop analogy.\nBoth these intruded and extruded areas can be the site of fracturing if the distortion of the bone exceeds the limits of its elasticity. The inner table will fracture where the skull is indented and the outer table will fracture at the margins of the deformed area.\nThe following images show the mechanism of skull fracture.\n\nOption A: Trauma most commonly causes subarachnoid hemorrhage, not subdural hemorrhage.\nOption B: Fractures lines of the skull do not cross each other. This forms the basis for Puppe's rule.\nOption D: The most common type of skull fracture is linear.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given clinical scenario describes lucid interval and it is classically associated with extradural/ epidural hemorrhage (EDH).\nPatients with EDH present with 3 phases:\nThe patient is initially unconscious from the concussive aspect of the head trauma.\nThe patient then awakens and has a lucid interval while the hematoma sub-clinically expands.\nAs the volume of the hematoma grows, intracranial pressure (ICP) increases, and the patient rapidly becomes lethargic and unconscious.\nA lucid interval is a period of normal consciousness and here the person is legally bound by the laws that affect normal people.\nThe image given below shows the intracranial hemorrhages.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nExtradural hemorrhages (EDH) cannot be ruled out in the absence of a skull fracture.\nMost EDH are associated with skull fractures. They usually occur unilaterally in the\nparieto-temporal area, caused by the rupture of the middle meningeal artery (usually posterior branch). However, they can occur rarely in the absence of any skull fractures or external injuries.\nIt is the least common type of brain membrane bleeding. A minimum volume of 35 ml is needed before clinical signs are apparent. The clinical signs of an epidural hemorrhage are classically those of a lucid or latent interval.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe diagnosis in the given scenario is that of a heat hematoma.\nHeat hematoma is an artifact that mimics EDH (extradural hemorrhage). This occurs when the head has been exposed to severe external heat sufficient to burn the scalp and skull. The blood may be extruded from the diplo\u00eb and venous sinuses into the extradural space to produce a heat hematoma. This false hematoma is brown and friable, and the adjacent brain tissue shows hardening and discoloration from the heat.\nThere is often a significant level of carboxyhemoglobin in the body if the death occurred when the fire was in progress. This should be of the same concentration in the heat hematoma as in the peripheral blood. If the victim suffered a head injury before the fire started (indicating an extradural hemorrhage), then there should be little or no carboxyhemoglobin in the hematoma.\nSolution to Question 11:\nA subdural hemorrhage is likely to be seen in an autopsy of victims of punch-drunk syndrome.\nThe punch-drunk syndrome is also known as dementia pugilistica. In this condition, gross findings of the brain include:\nCortical atrophy\nSlight hydrocephalus\nPerforated septum pellucidum\nEnlargement of the cavum pellucidum\nTearing of the septal leaves\nThe cortical atrophy leads to stretching of the bridging veins, which predisposes to a subdural hemorrhage. It is a cumulative process and many episodes of minor head injury add up to produce the typical lesions described.\nSolution to Question 12:\nA fall on the frontal region will not produce occipital contrecoup injuries. This is due to the relatively smooth internal surface of the posterior cranial fossa.\nCoup injury is damage that occurs on the same side of the direct trauma. Contrecoup injuries are present opposite to the site of trauma and is due to shear strain.\nFracture of the skull may not occur, even in the presence of severe coup and contrecoup injuries (option A). The skull's anterior and middle cranial fossae have sharp edges. This makes the temporal and frontal lobes highly prone to contrecoup injuries (option D).\nA fall on the temporal region can produce a contrecoup injury on the ipsilateral lobe due to the presence of the falx cerebri (option C).\nDuring the impact, the ipsilateral lobe moves in the opposite direction striking the falx cerebri, resulting in contrecoup injury on the same lobe (as the impact) but opposite to the site of initial trauma.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given scenario is most likely suggestive of diffuse axonal injury. The most reliable indicator is beta-amyloid precursor protein, seen earliest at 2-3 hours.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given image shows retraction balls/ globes which appear at 12-18 hours after injury.\nRetraction balls are bulbous and clubbed axons. The number of retraction balls begins to decrease 2-3 weeks after injury. This is followed by the appearance of a cluster of microglial cells, astrocytosis, and demyelination.\nSolution to Question 15:\nFrom the given options, the hippocampus is most likely to show evidence of damage in the case of a hypoxic brain injury like strangulation. However, third and fourth cortical layers are best for displaying the histological changes of hypoxia.\nThe parts of the brain most suitable for seeking evidence of hypoxic damage are:\nBoundary zones of the cerebral cortex (the grey matter) - most vulnerable because they lie at the terminal reach of the arterial supply\nHippocampus (especially CA1 sector = Sommer\u2019s area and subiculum)\nCerebellar folia\nGlobus pallidus in the basal ganglia\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe cervical spine is the most commonly injured part of the spinal cord.\nThe cervical spine accounts for 2/3rd of adult spine injuries. The most common part of the spine to be injured is the upper cervical vertebrae (C1\u2013C4).\nThe order of frequency of injury to the spinal cord is cervical &gt; thoracolumbar &gt; lumbar &gt;\nthoracic &gt; sacral level.\nSolution to Question 17:\nHyperextension is much more dangerous in causing spinal damage. It is because the weak anterior longitudinal ligament is incapable of preserving the integrity of the cervical spine during hyperextension.\nThe hyperflexion is protected by the contraction of the strong posterior neck muscles.\nSolution to Question 18:\nInjury to the brainstem and spinal cord above C4 vertebral level (as C4 vertebrae correspond to C5 spinal level) can be rapidly fatal from disruption of cardiorespiratory regulation centers.\nThe spinal respiratory center (origin of the phrenic nerve) is mostly composed of the C4 segment of the spinal cord, with a smaller contribution from C3 and C5 segments.\nSolution to Question 19:\nRugger jersey spine is not a concussion. It is an X-ray finding, which is characteristic of hyperparathyroidism seen in renal osteodystrophy. However, railway spine, commotio cordis, and Berlin edema are concussions.\nA concussion is a violent jerk or shock, or the condition which results from such an injury. The following are concussions of different organs:\nRailway spine - It can occur without any evidence of external injury to the spinal column. It results from a forcible blow on the back, a fall from height, or a bullet injury. It is commonly seen in railway accidents and motor car collisions, also known as the concussion of the spine.\nBerlin edema - It is the edema around the macular region of the retina, caused by a severe blow to the eyeball. It is also known as the concussion of the retina.\nCommotio Cordis - It is the damage to the heart that is frequently fatal. It is due to a sharp non-penetrating blow to the adjacent body surface.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe patient would survive the injury if it penetrates the left ventricle. In this chamber, the contraction of the layered thick wall may partly or wholly seal the wound, and bleeding can be slight. Hence, chances of survival are high.\nThe right ventricle is more commonly injured by a stab wound as it presents the largest frontal area. The injury to the right ventricle usually leads to copious bleeding into the pericardial sac. It is because of the inability of the thin wall to close the defect by muscle overlap and contraction.\nSolution to Question 21:\nLadder rung tears are multiple parallel intimal tears of the aorta, that are seen in deceleration trauma.\nIn these injuries, when the thorax is suddenly decelerated, the heart continues to move in the original direction. This causes severe traction on the root of the heart. This leads to ladder rung tears of the aorta.\nThese may or may not be associated with a complete transection of the aorta. If death is delayed, false aneurysms and dissections may be seen.\nSolution to Question 22:\nSpleen is the most common organ injured in blunt abdominal trauma.\nIn blunt trauma, organs that cannot yield to impact by elastic deformation are most likely to be injured, namely, the solid organs (spleen, liver, and kidneys).\nThe liver is the second most common organ involved in blunt abdominal trauma. The liver is the most commonly injured organ in penetrating trauma.\nSolution to Question 23:\nPincer contusions may be seen in trauma to the lungs.\nThe trauma may lead to bleeding in the lungs, which expands the lower parts of the lungs. The lower margins become trapped in the narrow costophrenic angles causing the contusions.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe likely cause of injury in the given scenario is shattered windshield glass injury.\nIn a road traffic accident, the shattered windshield glass produces multiple lacerations, usually on the face. These lacerations resemble sparrow footmarks due to contact with the shattered windscreen glass.\nSolution to Question 25:\nIn this case, head injury is an example of tertiary impact injury. The pedestrian sustained impacts twice (car bumper - primary, windshield - secondary) before hitting on the road.\nInjuries to pedestrians:\nPrimary impact injuries are caused by the first impact of the vehicle on the victim.\nSecondary impact injuries are further injuries caused by the vehicle.\nTertiary impact injuries are caused when the victim strikes other objects or falls on the ground after being hit by the vehicle.\nNote: In case a pedestrian is hit by the vehicle only once (i.e only primary impact and no secondary impact by the vehicle) and then sustains injuries by falling on the road, it would be an example of secondary injury.\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe rear seats of a car are more dangerous than the front seats.\nOption B: Airbags have greatly improved the safety of cars. However, they are associated with injuries themselves like, amputation of fingers, fracture of arms, cervical spine, and head injury.\nOption C: Thoracic injuries are more common in the driver than the front-seat passenger due to the steering wheel.\nOption D: Tail-gating accident occurs when a bike rider drives into the back of a truck. The bike passes underneath, but the head of the motorcyclist impacts on the tail-board. It may also happen to motor cars, and the rear of the truck smashes into the windscreen and driver.\nSolution to Question 27:\nLumbar spinal injury is not a major injury to the unrestrained driver of a vehicle in a deceleration impact. However, in these cases, cervical spinal injury is common.\nThe below image shows major points of injury to an unrestrained driver of a vehicle in deceleration impact.\n\nThermal Injuries\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following is not a thermal injury?\nLightning stroke\nBurns\nElectrical injuries\nGunshot\nQuestion 2:\nA person is considered to be hypothermic when their temperature falls below:",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nGunshot wound is not a thermal injury. Thermal injuries\nThermal deaths are those which result from the effects of systemic/localized exposure to excessive heat and cold.\nHeat\nCold\nOthers\nHeat crampsHeat prostration HeatstrokeHyperthermic anh ydrosis\nFrostbiteTrench footImmersi on footHypothermiaNeonatal cold injury\nBurnsScaldsElectrical injurie sLightning stroke\nSolution to Question 2:\nHypothermia occurs when the body's core temperature drops below 35\u00b0C.\nMild hypothermia \u2013 Core temperature 32 to 35\u00b0C (90 to 95\u00b0F)\nModerate hypothermia \u2013 Core temperature 28 to 32\u00b0C (82 to 90\u00b0F)\nSevere hypothermia \u2013 Core temperature below 28\u00baC (82\u00b0F)\nSolution to Question 3:\nOnce the body temperature has fallen below about 85\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), the ability of the hypothalamus to regulate temperature is lost.\nFor each 10\u00b0F decrease in body temperature, the rate of chemical heat production in each cell is depressed almost twofold. This is the reason for diminished temperature regulation. Sleepiness followed by coma, depresses the activity of the CNS heat control mechanisms and prevents shivering.\nSolution to Question 4:\nExtradural hematoma is not a common finding in patients with hypothermia. Autopsy findings of hypothermia:\nPink discoloration of the skin - due to persistent oxyhemoglobin in the skin capillaries.\nAcute gastric erosions - The stomach mucosa is frequently studded with numerous shallow ulcers called Wischnewski spots. The floor of each spot contains a dark brown plug of altered blood.\nAcute pancreatitis - present in less than half the deaths from proven hypothermia.\nPulmonary edema.\nPerivascular hemorrhages.\nThe image below shows Wischnewski spots:\n\nNote: A condition resembling extradural hematoma may be found in burns patients, called heat hematoma.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given phenomenon of paradoxical undressing is likely due to peripheral vasodilation.\nIt is a phenomenon encountered in severe hypothermic states. It is characterized by the act of active undressing, despite low ambient temperatures. Proposed mechanisms are:\nReflex vasoconstriction, which happens in the first stage of hypothermia, leads to paralysis of the vasomotor center thus giving rise to the sensation that the body temperature is higher than it really is.\nVasodilatation happens when cold-induced paralysis of the nerves in the vessel walls gives an absurd feeling of heat.\nOther associated features include:\nBruises and scratches of the knees, shanks, and upper limbs caused by late-phase attempts at crawling.\nThe hide-and-die phenomenon in some cases.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe most likely explanation for the given scenario is terminal burrowing behaviour or hide and die syndrome.\nAn elderly lady with hypothyroidism is more likely to develop hypothermia. About 20% of hypothermia cases are associated with terminal burrowing behaviour.\nIn some cases the bodies were found in strange situations, i.e. lying under a bed, behind a wardrobe, or on a shelf, etc. indicating that the final positions were a kind of self-protective burrowing-like behaviour.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of heatstroke and a core temperature &gt;40.5\u00b0C helps establish the diagnosis.\nAs body core temperature rises, excessive cutaneous vasodilation can lead to a fall in arterial pressure and therefore to a decrease in brain perfusion. This leads to a total loss of thermoregulatory function. As core temperature approaches 41\u00baC, sweating stops, confusion and, ultimately, loss of consciousness occurs.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe Baux score was used for many years to predict mortality in burns. Baux score: Mortality risk = age + %TBSA\nAdvancements in burn care have lowered overall mortality to the point that the Baux score may no longer be accurate. However, age and burn size, as well as inhalation injury, continues to be the most robust indicators for burn mortality.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe lowest temperature that causes burn damage is 44\u00b0C and requires 5-6 hours before a burn appears.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe three-stage classification of burn degrees was provided by Wilson. Wilson classification of burns:\nFirst degree - Erythema and blistering without loss of dermis\nSecond degree - Destruction of the full thickness of skin\nThird-degree - Destruction of deeper tissues below the skin\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe Lund-Browder burn diagram is the most precise method of estimation of burn surface area in children and adults.\nThis allows an accurate age-adjusted determination of burn size for a given depth, allowing for the anatomical differences of children.\nMethods of estimation of burn surface area:\nRule of nines (Wallace) - It divides the body into segments that are approximately 9% or multiples of 9%, with the perineum forming the remaining 1%. Because of the proportionately larger heads and smaller legs of infants and children, this method must be modified in pediatric burn injuries.\n\nUse of patient's hand - The area of the back of the patient\u2019s hand is approximately 1% of their total body surface area. The number of 'hands' that equal the area of the burn can approximate the percentage of body surface area burned.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe primary cause of late mortality in burns is septicemia and multiorgan failure.\nThe primary cause of early mortality in burns is burn shock. The term burn shock describes the rapidly developing hypovolemic circulatory failure seen in the first 72 hours after burns.\nSolution to Question 13:\nElevated levels of carbon monoxide in the circulating blood and carbon particles in the air passages and lungs are reliable indicators suggesting that the victim was alive while the fire was in progress.\nThe carbon monoxide concentration in blood depends on various factors like the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air, blood hemoglobin level, duration of exposure, etc. The presence of carbon particles and elevated Carboxy hemoglobin levels are absolute proof that the victim was alive when the fire occurred. Though there is no definite level that confirms the presence or absence of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood, a level of 10% is needed to confirm unless the person is a heavy smoker.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe attitude of general flexion called the pugilistic attitude is seen in a burn victim.\nMuscle contractures are common where substantial heat has reached the body. The muscle becomes shortened by dehydration and protein denaturation. The flexors, being bulkier than the extensors, contract more and force the limbs into a position of general flexion, the so-called boxer's or pugilistic attitude.\nSolution to Question 15:\nIn the above scenario, there is no evidence that indicates the victim may have died from a homicidal injury and that the fire may have been used to cover up the crime.\nThe lacerated-looking wounds found in this victim are spurious findings commonly found in burn victims.\nSpurious wounds in burns :\nSkin splits - Heated skin contracts markedly and splits often appear. These splits may be anywhere but are especially seen over extensor surfaces and joints, as well on the head. The false split will show no bleeding in the deeper tissues and its position is usually suggestive.\nHeat hematoma - the mass of blood resembling a true extradural hematoma may form between the skull and the dura. This may arise either from venous sinuses or out of the diploic space in the skull through emissary venous channels.\nIf death occured during the fire (antemortem), levels of carboxyhemoglobin will be elevated in the blood and the heat hematoma. If the victim died before the fire (postmortem), the levels of carboxyhemoglobin will be little to none.\nSolution to Question 16:\nHeat fractures of the skull are most commonly seen at the sides of the skull, usually bilaterally.\nFractures to the base of the skull are unheard of in the case of thermal fractures and should be considered to be an antemortem injury.\nHeat fractures of the skull take approximately 20 minutes of heat application before the skull starts to crack\nThe pattern of fracture commonly resembles a spider web. They may cross the suture line but usually do not involve the sutures, even in young persons with un-united sutures.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe image shows a 'Marjolin ulcer' which is a rare type of SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) that arises in sites of chronic wounds or scars.\nThe malignant transformation is slow, with an average latency time of approx 30 years. The tumor may initially present as:\nUlceration\nNodules\nRolled or everted wound margins\nExcessive granulation tissue\nA rapid increase in size\nBleeding on touch.\nSolution to Question 18:\nCurling's ulcers are seen in burn victims.\nThis is seen due to intravascular depletion leading to mucosal ischemia and disruption of the protective mucosal barrier.\nH2 -receptor antagonists or PPIs have proved effective against the development of stress gastritis.\nNote: Brain tumors, traumatic head injury, and other intracranial processes including infections can cause increased intracranial pressure. This leads to overstimulation of the vagus nerve. As a result, increased secretion of gastric acid may occur which leads to gastro-duodenal ulcer formation known as Cushing's ulcer.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe given image shows a scald injury. A chemical fire is going to cause a burn, not a scald.\nScalds are sharply demarcated lesions with reddening, desquamation, and blistering. When tipped or splashed, the hot liquid runs under gravity so that trickle patterns may be seen.\nIt is caused due to tissue damage from hot liquids like:\nHot water\nHot oils\nMolten rubber\nLiquid chemicals\nSteam.\nSolution to Question 20:\nAlternating current is more damaging than direct current.\nIt has been claimed that the most dangerous current path is contacted with the right hand and exits through the left foot, as this causes the maximum of the total body current to flow through the heart. when compared with head to feet, left hand to feet, hand to hand, or foot to foot.\nMost deaths from electricity are from cardiac arrhythmias, usually, ventricular fibrillation ending in cardiac arrest.\nIt is commonly said that tolerance can be gained to electric shock and that professional electricians often work on live 240 V conductors with impunity.\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe term used to describe the burns shown in the image is filigree burn or arborescent burn or Lichtenberg\u2019s flower or feathering. It is a finding in burns due to lightning.\nThe fern-like pattern of erythema in the skin indicates the path taken by the electrical discharge. It usually occurs over the shoulder or the flanks within an hour of the injury and disappears in a\nday or two. It occurs due to the rupture of small vessels and is seen in a fern-like pattern or the branching of a tree.\nOption B: When the skin is in firm contact with an electrical conductor, splitting of the layers of the epidermis or those of the epidermal-dermal junction. This may in turn produce a raised blister known as a Joule burn.\nThe image below shows a Joule burn:\n\nOption C: When the contact is less firm, an air gap is formed between the skin and the conductor. Thus the current traverses the gap as a spark. This leads to a distinct hard brownish keratin nodule raised above the surrounding surface known as a spark lesion.\nOption A: Crocodile skin effect is caused by high-tension current burns, where the voltage is in the multi-kilovolt range, sparking may occur over many centimeters. This can cause multiple spark lesions giving rise to a crocodile-skin effect.\nThe image below shows multiple spark lesions and the inset shows the crocodile skin effect:\n\nImage below shows the various electrical marks.\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nWhen the contact with the electrocuting surface is not firm, the skin lesion that develops is called a spark lesion.\nWhen the contact is less firm, an air gap (albeit narrow) exists between skin and conductor the current jumps the gap as a spark. This causes the outer skin keratin to melt over a small area. On cooling, the keratin fuses into a hard brownish nodule, usually raised above the surrounding surface.\nVarious skin lesions in electrical injury:\nWhen the skin has been in firm contact with an electrical conductor, this may split the layers of the epidermis or the epidermal-dermal junction and produce a raised blister called Joule burns.\nIn high-voltage burns, such as those sustained from high-tension grid transmission cables, where the voltage is in the multi-kilovolt range, sparking may occur over many centimeters. This can cause multiple spark lesions giving rise to a \u2018crocodile-skin\u2019 effect.\nThe heat generated by the current may melt the calcium phosphate, which is radiologically seen as typical round dense foci called as 'bone pearls' or 'wax drippings'.\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe hold-on effect is seen in electrical injuries.\nWhen the entry point is in the hand, the stronger flexor muscles of the arm go into spasm\nand cause a hold-on effect. Any object being held in the hand is involuntarily clenched and the current thus continues to flow.\nFirearm Injuries and Blast Injuries\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the study of the processes in a firearm known as?\nForensic ballistics\nInternal ballistics\nExternal ballistics\nTerminal ballistics\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is a smooth barrel weapon?\nShotgun\nRevolver\nSingle shot pistol\nMachine guns\nQuestion 3:\nThe term 'choking' as understood in ballistics, applies to which of the following?\nBarrel of a shotgun\nAmmunition of a shotgun\nBarrel of a rifled gun\nMechanism to increase the range of shots fire\nQuestion 4:\nWhich of the following is useful in identifying the make and model of a gun?\nPrimary markings\nSecondary markings\nBullet fingerprinting\nRifling\nQuestion 5:\nWhich of the following marked distances is described as the caliber of a rifled gun?\n\nDistance D\nDistance C\nDistance B\nDistance A\nQuestion 6:\nWhich of the following structures is not found in a shotgun ammunition?\nWads\nMetal cylinder\nPercussion detonator\nPrimer\nQuestion 7:\nWhich of the following are constituents of smokeless gunpowder?",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe study of the processes in a firearm is known as internal ballistics.\nBallistics is the science of mechanics that deals with the flight, behaviour and effects of projectiles. It has the following types:\nInternal ballistics deals with the processes in a firearm.\nExternal/Exterior ballistics deals with the behaviour of the projectile after leaving the barrel.\nWound ballistics comprises the changes caused when a missile penetrates a human or animal body.\nForensic ballistics is the application of ballistics for forensic purposes\nTerminal ballistics deals with the study of the interaction of a projectile with its target.\nSolution to Question 2:\nShotgun is a smooth barrel weapon. It is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug.\nTypes of firearms:\nThe image given below shows a shotgun.\nRifled weapons\nSmooth barrel weapons (Shot gun)\nRifles:Air and gas operated ri flesMilitary and sporting rifle sSingle shot pistolsRevolvers Automatic pistolsTrue autom atic weapons (machine guns)\nSingle barrelDouble barrelSli de-actionBolt-actionSemi-aut omaticAutomatic\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nChoking is a modification applied to the barrel of a shotgun.\nChoke is where the barrel is modified such that it slightly tapers towards the muzzle. This will produce a narrower cone of shot when the ammunition is fired and thus, prevents dispersion of pellets. This can thus affect estimation of range of firing when examining the entry wound.\nTypes of choking:\nImproved cylinder\nModified choke\nHalf-choke\nFull-choke\nNote: The choke is a device towards the tapered end of the muzzle of a shotgun that aids in the estimates of range derived from the size of the wound and controls the shot pattern. It does not increase the range of the shotgun thus making option A the appropriate choice.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nPrimary markings is specific to the make and model of the gun. These are formed when a bullet passes through a barrel and the sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel.\nIrregularities on the inner surface of the barrel itself which are specific for that particular weapon are also seen on the bullet and are called secondary markings / characteristic markings.\nSecondary markings are used for bullet fingerprinting.\nRifling is the process of adding spiral grooves on to the inside of the barrel of a gun. The elevations between the grooves are called 'lands'. These grip the bullet and impart onto it a rotatory movement. This has a gyroscopic effect that increases the stability of the bullet's trajectory and hence the accuracy.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe caliber of a rifled gun is described as the marked distance C in the image. Caliber is measured as the distance between two diametrically opposite lands.\nIt is the internal dimension of the barrel and is measured in millimeters or inches.\n\nNote: For a smooth barrel weapon, it is measured as the distance between two diametrically opposite points on the inner circumference.\nSolution to Question 6:\nA shotgun cartridge does not have a metal cylinder. It has a metal base, but the cylinder is made of cardboard.\nThe ammunition for the shotgun is a cartridge made of a cardboard or plastic cylinder fitted into a metal base. The base carries a percussion detonator that is struck by the spring-loaded firing pin when the trigger is pulled. The primer is located in the percussion cup and contains the detonator. The cartridge contains a charge of propellant (gunpowder), above which are \u2018wads\u2019 or pistons of felt, cardboard or plastic discs, or both. Above these is the charge of shot (pellets), which varies greatly in number and size, finally covered by a card or plastic disc.\nThe image given below shows a shotgun cartridge.\n\nThe ammunition of a rifled weapon has a metal cylinder, closed at one end, which is the shell or cartridge. The cylinder carries a percussion detonator in the base, either centrally or peripherally. The shell is loaded with an explosive propellant such as nitrocellulose and the bullet is firmly clamped into the open end.\nThe image given below shows the cartridge of a rifled gun.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nSmokeless gunpowder contains nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose and nitroguanidine.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe radiograph is suggestive of a close-range shotgun blast injury to the knee. Birdshot pellets are visible within and around the shattered patella, distal femur, and proximal tibia.\nThe ammunition for the shotgun is a cartridge made of a cardboard or plastic cylinder fitted into a metal base. The base carries a percussion detonator that is struck by the spring-loaded firing pin when the trigger is pulled. The primer is located in the percussion cup and contains the detonator. The cartridge contains a charge of propellant (gunpowder), above which are \u2018wads\u2019 or pistons of felt, and cardboard or plastic discs, or both. Above these is the charge of shot (pellets), which varies greatly in number and size, finally covered by a card or plastic disc.\nThe image given below shows the entry wound in the case of a shotgun. There is a central round hole, with multiple pellet holes scattered around the central hole. This wound is most likely to have been caused by a shotgun from a range of 1-5 m.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nBurning, partly burnt and unburnt propellant flakes and grains may pepper the surrounding of the wound. This effect is known as tattooing.\nEffects seen in entry wounds:\nEffect\nDescription\nRange at which it is seen in s hotgun wound\nRange at which it is seen in ri fled gun wound\nBurning\nBurning of skin and singeing of hair from hot gases\n<30 cm\n<15 cm\nSoiling\nFrom the smoke/soot\n<50 cm\n<15 cm\nTattooing\nPeppering of the skin with un burnt/partially burnt gunpow der\n<1 metres",

    "question_text": "\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe retrograde propulsion of tissue from the entry wound towards the firearm is known as backspatter.\nGunshot contact wounds and close-range discharges may cause blood and tissue fragments to enter the muzzle. It is due to negative pressure created following the discharge. This is known as backspatter.\nSometimes blood and tissue may soil the hand or arm of the person firing the gun, a matter of considerable significance in forensic science.\nOption A: Blowback phenomenon: This is seen at the entry wound in a contact shot against a bone, where the gases rebound against the bone and exit through the entry wound, creating a stellate shaped margin at the entry wound.\nOption B &amp; C: Retrodispersion and backward scatter are not effects seen in firearm injuries.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn the given image, A is the entry wound as it has a clean punched-in appearance on the outer table of the skull. Whereas B is the exit wound as it shows beveling (sloping surface) on the outer table of the skull.\nEntry wound: The initial contact of the missile punches a clean hole through the outer table of the skull. Where the bullet emerges internally, the inner table is then unsupported and a cone-shaped\nplug is detached, forming a crater that is appreciably larger than the external hole.\nBevelling: inner table\nPunched out hole: outer table\nExit wound: If the bullet traverses the cranium and penetrates the opposite side, the same pattern occurs, this time with the small hole on the inner table and the crater on the outside.\nBevelling: outer table\nPunched out hole: inner table\n\nKr\u00f6nlein shot is a rare injury of the skull caused by a close-range shot. Here, the cranium is blasted open and large pieces of brain matter are ejected out of the skull.\nSolution to Question 15:\nGrease ring is a reliable sign to differentiate entry from an exit wound.\nThe abrasion collar or its inner parts may be blackened due to overlying sooty remnants wiped off by the bullet when hitting uncovered skin. This finding is called a grease ring, a ring of dirt or bullet wipe-off. It can be regarded as a reliable sign of entrance.\nOption A: Inverted edges cannot be regarded as a reliable sign of entry wound. The edges of an entry wound may be everted by the blowback phenomenon in a contact wound. This occurs when the gases strike a bony surface and are reflected back, everting the entry wound edges.\nOption B: The round shape of entry wounds is unreliable as entry wounds and exit wounds may be of many shapes. This depends on many factors, including the range of firing, angle of firing, presence of subcutaneous bone, etc.\nOption C: In an abrasion collar the skin immediately around the central hole is discoloured, the so-called \u2018abrasion collar\u2019 or \u2018contusion ring\u2019. The abrasion ring is primarily due to the massive overstretching and subsequent drying-up of the skin adjacent to the area of projectile impact. It\ncannot be taken as a reliable sign of entry wound as an exit wound may have a spurious abrasion collar. This occurs when the exit wound is supported against a hard surface and the emerging bullet slams the wound periphery against this surface.\nSolution to Question 16:\nAll the bullets mentioned in the options are modified to ensure that on entering the body, they slow down enough to impart maximum damage except tracer bullets.\nFor damage to occur, some or all of the kinetic energy of the missile has to be absorbed by the target tissues, where it is dissipated as heat, noise and mechanical disruption. When a missile passes completely through soft tissues, it may retain much of its original kinetic energy and fail to transfer any appreciable amount to the tissues.\nTo ensure transfer of energy to the tissues, some missiles are especially designed or modified to slow up or stop within the body.\nSoftheaded bullets will flatten on impact and some are designed to fragment.\nThe dumdum bullet fragments upon striking and transfers more energy for tissue displacement and disruption.\nExplosive-tipped bullets, cause fire in the target due to the presence of explosives at the tip. They are designed to deform the missile to cause maximum deceleration.\n\nTracer bullet sparks during flight. It contains a mixture of barium nitrate, powdered magnesium and strontium nitrate.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe shape of the wound cavity can be explained by yawing of the bullet.\nYawing is a common phenomenon seen with bullets (not with spheres). It is the rotation of the bullet around a lateral axis while passing through dense media such as tissues.\nThe angle between the trajectory and the long axis of the bullet increases due to destabilising forces until it reaches 90 degrees , i.e., the bullet\u2019s long axis is perpendicular to the trajectory. The yawing motion then continues until 180 degrees and the bullet will remain in this stable position where the base is the leading part.\nThe path of a projectile in a dense medium therefore shows three distinct sections, depending on the respective cross-sectional area:\nNarrow channel\nIncreased cavities\nTail en\nSolution to Question 18:\nScanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM\u2013EDX) is the most sensitive as well as the most commonly used test for detection of gunshot residue.\nTests for detection of gunpowder residue:\nDermal nitrate (paraffin) test\nHarrison and Gilroy test\nNeutron activation analysis (NAA)\nFlameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS)\nInductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) - a variant of Flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy\nScanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM -EDX)\nSolution to Question 19:\nLead snowstorm is the phenomenon caused by a firearm wound, when lead fragments are stripped from the bullet as it travels through the body. It causing multiple fragments to be present along the wound track.\nThis phenomenon is caused by semi-jacketed hunting ammunition used in rifled guns.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe bullet should be packed in leakproof packaging made of hard plastic. Precautions to be followed while recovering a bullet from a crime scene:\nBullets should be handled only by persons wearing double heavy-duty gloves (and not by bare hands - due to risk of contamination).\nTo prevent marring of the bullet surface, it should be removed by a plastic forceps or a rubber-tipped bullet extractor.\nThe bullet is gently rinsed after collection of any trace evidence on the bullet. The rinsing removes any contaminating body fluids to decrease infective risk.\nThe bullet or bullet fragments should be double packed in leakproof packaging with at least one of the containers made out of hard plastic.\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of a bullet graze.\nBullet graze: the bullet just hits the skin only at an angle and goes off from the site, without any penetration or wound of entry. It produces an abrasion or a laceration depending on the thickness of the skin involved.\nBullet bruise: the bullet here just hits the skin only and drops down to the ground, without any penetration or wound of entry. It produces a bruise alone at the site of impact.\nSolution to Question 22:\nBullet wipe is due to the grease, soot or debris from the barrel of the gun.\nWhile examining the clothing of a victim of bullet injury, there is a deposition of various residues surrounding the entrance defect at various ranges known as Bullet wipe. It helps in determining the wounds of inlet and outlet upon the body.\nSolution to Question 23:\nBullet collected at surgery or autopsy, from the body of a victim alive or dead is called a crime bullet.\nTest bullet is a bullet that is fired from a weapon suspected of being involved in a crime; the test firing is into a gunny bag fixed into a deal wood box. The bullet is then collected for comparison with crime bullet under a comparison microscope, for identifying the crime weapon.This can only be done in relation to rifled weapons.\nExhibit bullet is a crime/test bullet, which is presented in the court as evidence.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe kind of bullet identified by the radiologist as explained in the given scenario is known as souvenir bullet.\nSouvenir bullet is the one which has been lodged in the body for a long time with no fresh bleeding around it and surrounded by a dense fibrous tissue capsule. They can be visualized on X-rays. They are usually a result of bullet lodging in an inaccessible space which may result in more damage on attempted retrieval. e.g. Bullet in the spine.\nOther options:\nTandem bullet (Piggyback bullet): This is where two bullets come out with a single shot. Seen with unused or locally made weapons. It may cause confusion with the number of entry and exit wounds.\nIncendiary bullets: Type of army bullet used to cause fire in the target.\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe correct match would be as follows:\nPuppe's rule: Helps in determining the sequence of bullets to hit the skull, when there are multiple bullet injuries to skull. The fracture line resulting from the later bullet will typically stop at the previously formed one.\nTerm\nDescription",

      "Relationship between trau ma and new growth Kennedy's phenomenon: Surgical intervention of a firearm wound leading to an artefact as the evaluation of wound as entry or exit wound becomes difficult. Rayalaseema phenomenon: Here a person is killed by stab injury, and a bullet is implanted inside to mislead the investigation. Ewing's postulates: Establishes a relationship between trauma and new growth. The following postulates should be satisfied before a relationship between trauma and new growth is accepted: Evidence of previous integrity of the injured part. Undeniable and adequate trauma must be proved. There must be a proof of reasonable time interval between injury and appearance of tumour. Disease must develop at the exact site of injury. The nature of the tumour must be proved. Solution to Question 26: The sequence of gunshots, in this case, is 1\uf0b0  2\uf0b0  3 according to Puppe's rule. Puppe's rule states that the path of a second fracture line does not cross the path of an existing fracture line that appears or was caused before it. This helps the forensic expert determine the chronology (order) in which the bullets were lodged into the skull. Puppe's rule is used in forensic examination of skull fractures caused by multiple blunt force vectors as well, as it is not limited to the examination of bullet injuries only. Solution to Question 27: Molotov cocktail is an incendiary bomb that is thrown by hand. In this crude type of bomb, a bottle is filled with gasoline and a rag to serve as a wick, the wick is lit and thrown at the target.  Solution to Question 28: In underwater blasts, the intestines suffer the most damage. A blast causes the most damage at an interface between tissues in contact with the atmosphere, which is why the lung usually suffers the most severe damage. However the most commonly affected structure in air blasts is the tympanic membrane. The gastrointestinal system suffers from the effect of a blast because, like the lung, it contains air and gases, and is thus not a uniform medium for transit of the shock wave. Victims of explosions in water suffer a reverse order of gastrointestinal to lung damage. Note: In air, the ear, especially the tympanic membrane is severely damaged, however, in a cadaver it is not discernible without an otoscopic examination of the tympanic membrane. Nevertheless, lungs are considered to be the severely damaged organ in the air due to variations in density between the alveolar walls and the contained air. Solution to Question 29: The given history of multiple small puncture wounds to the right side of the chest, below the nipple, and multiple small abrasions and bruising over the left lower abdomen are highly suggestive of blast injuries sustained due to flying missiles. Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion causing a sudden increase or decrease in atmospheric pressure. T.K.Marshall\u2019s (Marshall's triad) described the characteristic injuries associated with bomb explosions. It includes: Abrasions Bruises/contusions Puncture lacerations Blast injuries are classified as: Primary injuries: Effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. The external injuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle, ear, lungs, an gastrointestinal tract are the most susceptible to this. Secondary injuries: Injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries. Tertiary injuries: These are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Quaternary injuries: All other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three categories. eg, flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc. Option B: Blast of air or blast wave cause primary injuries which involve internal organs without external injury. Option C: Explosion burns: When the bomb explodes, the temperature of the explosive gases can exceed 2000\u00b0C, and the heat radiated momentarily can cause flash burns. It is a quaternary type of blast injury. Option D: Building collapse can cause crush injuries which is a quaternary blast injury.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of suffocation due to aspiration of food particles. It is classified under mechanical asphyxia.\nMechanical asphyxia can be classified depending on the respiratory block:\nCompression / constriction of the neck - Hanging, strangulation, throttling\nBlocking external orifices of respiration, i.e. mouth and/or nostrils - Smothering, overlying, suffocation, gagging\nImpaction of foreign bodies in respiratory tract - Choking\nCompression and mechanical fixation of the chest and abdomen preventing the respiratory movements - Traumatic asphyxia / crush asphyxia\nInhalation of fluid into the respiratory tract - Drowning\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe image shows petechiae called Tardieu spots. They are an unreliable sign of asphyxial death.\nHemorrhages if larger than 2 mm are called ecchymoses and smaller than 2 mm are called petechiae. They are common non-specific autopsy findings and many are post-mortem in origin, especially in the dependent positions. They are caused by the rupture of small venules (capillary bleeding is invisible to the naked eye).\nIt is suggested that the elevated expression of P-selectin could be used as a criterion to distinguish between antemortem findings from post-mortem artifacts.\nOther non-specific signs of asphyxia are:\nCongestion of the larynx with slight oozing\nEmphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli\nCyanosis or dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe most marked congestion and cyanosis are seen in a case of traumatic asphyxia.\nIt is the mechanical fixation of the chest (sitting on the chest). It acts by restricting respiratory movements and thus prevents inspiration.\nThe four signs of asphyxia are as follows.\nPetechial haemorrhages\nCongestion and edema\nCyanosis\nEngorgement of the right heart and abnormal fluidity of the blood.\nThese signs are non-specific. But in traumatic asphyxia, there is a marked demonstration of these signs. In no other condition, apart from postural dependency, is the degree of congestion and cyanosis so marked.\nThe image shows the marked congestion seen in traumatic asphyxia.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe image depicts smothering. It refers to the blockage of the external air passages, usually by a hand or soft fabric.\nMechanical asphyxia can be classified depending on the respiratory block:\nCompression / constriction of the neck - Hanging, strangulation, throttling\nBlocking external orifices of respiration, i.e. mouth and/or nostrils - Smothering, overlying, suffocation, gagging\nImpaction of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract - Choking\nCompression and mechanical fixation of the chest and abdomen preventing the respiratory movements - Traumatic asphyxia / crush asphyxia\nInhalation of fluid into the respiratory tract - Drowning\nSolution to Question 5:\nAbrasions around the mouth, cheeks, lips or lesions within the lips may reliably indicate smothering.\nThe non-specific signs in deaths due to asphyxia:\nPetechial hemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera - When they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu\u2019s spots\nEmphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli\nCyanosis or dark-colored blood due to accumulation of CO2.\nCongestion of the larynx with slight oozing\nPressure marks on the face can occur as a part of normal postmortem changes. Circumoral and circumnasal pallor can be caused merely by passive pressure of the dependent head after death.\nNote: The coexistence of these findings, in themselves, does not prove that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia. All these phenomena are non-specific and are in no way peculiar to this mode of death. They are of no value in proving that death resulted from mechanical asphyxia.\nSolution to Question 6:\nBurking is a combination of smothering and traumatic asphyxia.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe clinical scenario is most likely suggestive of cafe coronary syndrome. Death in caf\u00e9 coronary syndrome occurs due to parasympathetic overactivity. It is sudden and unexpected and happens rapidly.\nThis is usually seen in well-built businessmen. In this syndrome, the victim dies during a meal with no signs of respiratory distress or classical signs of asphyxia.\nThe cause of death in these patients is mechanical asphyxia leading to vasovagal reflex causing reflex cardiac inhibition. The mode of death is cardiac arrest (not the cause of death) presumably from parasympathetic overactivity occurring from stimulation of the laryngeal or pharyngeal mucosa.\nSuppressed gag reflex due to gross intoxication with alcohol or large doses of tranquilizers in mental institutions or hospitals might be the predisposing factors. Autopsy reveals a bolus of food, lodged in the pharynx or larynx.\nSolution to Question 8:\nBleeding from the nose, mouth, and ears is commonly associated with death due to ligature strangulation.\nSolution to Question 9:\nDamage to the laryngeal structures is more in manual strangulation than in ligature strangulation. During manual strangulation the following structures are damaged:\nHyoid cornua or horns\nSuperior thyroid horns\nCricoid cartilage\nThe main ala of the thyroid cartilage\nIt has been said that such direct violence from the front tends to splay the fractured horns laterally, whereas in manual strangulation the horn tends to fall medially.\nIf there is no haemorrhage, the fracture must be post mortem. If there is a small bleed, then the lesion can be either antemortem or post-mortem. Large bleeds definitely indicate an antemortem fracture.\nDamage to the laryngeal cartilages is much less common in ligature strangulation than in manual strangulation.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe image shows the tightening of a noose around the neck by twisting a rod within the ligature. This is called garrotting.\nThis is a mode of ligature strangulation that may be seen in homicide.\nThis was a form of judicial execution once employed in Spain. The rod-like object used to tighten the ligature is called a Spanish windlass - this may be a ruler, stick, or screwdriver. The method was also used by Thagi\u2019s in the past in India, to kill the travelers and rob their belongings in lonely places.\nSolution to Question 11:\nIncising the internal jugular vessels early in the autopsy is done to relieve venous pressure, especially in cases where strangulation is suspected. This can help prevent artefactual haemorrhages that could otherwise complicate the interpretation of findings.\nDuring an autopsy, it is essential to release the blood in the venous system before dissecting the neck to avoid or reduce artefactual haemorrhages that can occur in the region.\nThe following methods are also followed while conducting the autopsy:\nReflect the scalp and remove the brain before dealing with the neck to release venous engorgement\nMultislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or radiography of the neck may be carried out before dissecting.\nIf the new techniques of post-mortem imaging are not available an alternative method is to X-ray the isolated larynx before dissection.\nSolution to Question 12:\nBoth bruising around the neck and the fracture of the thyroid cartilage are findings seen in throttling.\nThrottling/manual strangulation is when bare hands are used to compress the neck and strangulate.\nMechanism of death:\nOcclusion of blood vessels supplying blood to the brain (carotid arteries).\nCarotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation, resulting in cardiac arrest (vagal inhibition).\nOcclusion of the airway probably - a minor role Autopsy findings:\nBruising of the neck- due to the grasping of the neck by the assailant.\nAbrasions on the neck- fingernail marks from assailant or victim.\nFracture of the thyroid cartilage.\nInward fracture of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given autposy images are suggestive of throttling.\n\n\n\nIn throttling, the following mechanisms may lead to death:\nOcclusion of blood supply to the blood to the brain - carotid arteries\nOcclusion of the airway - minor role\nCarotid sinus pressure may result in vagus nerve stimulation resulting in cardiac arrest\n(vasovagal shock)\nOther signs in deaths due to asphyxia:\nPetechial hemorrhages in the face, eyebrows, eyelids, forehead, ears, conjunctiva, sclera\nWhen they occur in the visceral pleura, they are called Tardieu\u2019s spots\nCongested larynx with slight oozing\nMarked venous congestion of internal organs\nEmphysematous, congested lungs with serosanguinous fluid exudates in alveoli\nDark-coloured blood due to accumulation of CO2\nOption B: Strangulation is a very generalised term used to describe deaths due to violent asphyxia. Eg- ligature strangulation, throttling etc\nOption C: In the case of hanging, there will be a ligature mark, injury to the cervical spine etc.\nOption D: In case of mugging the neck is compressed or squeezed by holding it between the crook of the elbow or knee. The attack is usually made from behind. Though a victim killed by this method shows signs of asphyxia and other struggle marks, the examination neck will not show any evidence of violence, as the compression was affected by the soft muscles of the arm or leg.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn an inverted crucifixion, death occurs due to postural asphyxia.\nIn the case of inverted crucifixion, asphyxia occurs as a result of the impedance of inspiration by the weight of the abdominal viscera upon the diaphragm.\nSolution to Question 15:\nJack-knife position leads to positional asphyxia.\nIt is a position where the victim's thighs and knees are driven against the chest causing indirect compression of the chest and restriction of breathing movements.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe type of strangulation shown in the given image is mugging.\nThe term strictly means throttling by pressure from an arm held around the throat. The attack is usually made from behind, the neck being trapped in the crook of the elbow. Pressure is then exerted either on the front of the larynx or at one or both sides by the forearm and upper arm.\nNote: The original meaning of \u2018mugging\u2019 has now been confused by its application, especially in North America, to any form of robbery with violence.\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe weight of the head, arms, and chest acts as a constricting force in partial hanging. Types of hanging:\nComplete hanging - the weight of the entire body acts as a constricting force.\nPartial hanging - the bodies are partially suspended, the weight of the head (5-6 kgs), arms, an chest act as a constricting force.\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nAbout 15 kg of tension in the ligature around the neck occludes the jugular vein, carotid artery and trachea.\nThe force required to occlude the neck structures are as follows:\n2 kg - occludes the jugular veins.\n5 kg - occlude the jugular veins and carotid arteries.\n15 kg - occludes the jugular veins, carotid arteries and trachea.\n30 kg - occludes the jugular veins, carotid arteries, trachea and vertebral arteries.\nSolution to Question 19:\nCauses of death in suicidal hangings are not from laryngeal spasms. Mechanisms of death in pressure on the neck:\nAirway occlusion\nOcclusion of the neck veins\nOcclusion of the carotid arteries\nVagal cardiac arrest\nDeath ultimately occurs from cerebral hypoxia and ischemic neuronal death.\nAsphyxia\nCommonest mode of death\nManual strangulation\nVagal cardiac arrest\nAsphyxia\nCommonest mode of death\nLigature strangulatio n\nAsphyxia\nJudicial hanging\nDisruption of vertebral colu mn\nSolution to Question 20:\nHanging marks almost never completely encircles the neck unless a slipknot was used. The hanging mark has the following features:\nThe point of suspension is indicated by a gap in the skin mark - This gap is usually seen at one or other side of the neck or at the center of the back of the neck. Much less often it is under the chin.\nIt is situated higher above the thyroid cartilage - Being directly under the chin anteriorly, passing round beneath the jawbones and rising up at the sides or back of the neck to the usual gap under the knot.\nThe mark may be abraded, brown, and dried to a parchment-like consistency after death.\nnarrow red zone either above or below (or both sides) of the ligature mark - Due to displacement of blood laterally from under the zone of maximum pressure.\nSolution to Question 21:\nDribbling of saliva will be seen in a case of suicidal hanging. This is considered as the surest sign of antemortem hanging as secretion of saliva is a vital function and it cannot occur after death.\nAutopsy findings in hanging:\nPost-mortem hypostasis is present in the legs and hands.\nPetechial haemorrhages - these are usually the exception, rather than the rule.\nLigature mark - above the thyroid cartilage, incomplete, parchment-like consistency\nSoft tissue haemorrhage may be seen.\nLaryngeal fractures - fractures of hyoid and thyroid may be seen.\nAmussat sign - damage to intima and media of the carotid artery\nSimon's sign - haemorrhages on the anterior aspects of intervertebral disks.\nVertebral artery tears- The vertebral artery can show intimal tears, subintimal haemorrhages, and even rupture.\nA pale face is more commonly seen than congestion of the face.\nLe facies sympathique - eyes remain open and pupils remain dilated due to compression of cervical sympathetic chain on the same side. It indicates antemortem hanging.\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe knot in a case of judicial hanging is placed under the ear in India.\nA legal death sentence is carried out by hanging the criminal. The face of the person is covered with a dark mask and he is made to stand on a platform above trapdoors\nA rope to allow a drop of five to seven meters according to the weight, build and age of the person, is looped around the neck, with the knot under the angle of the jaw.\nAlthough placing the knot beneath the chin i.e, the submental position is said to be a more effective way, a knot at the angle of the jaw (below the ear) is the most widely practised method of judicial hanging in India\nSolution to Question 23:\nSimon\u2019s haemorrhage / Simon\u2019s sign / Simon\u2019s symptom is streaky haemorrhage on the anterior aspects of the intervertebral disc, particularly in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. It is frequently observed in cases of hanging.\nSimon haemorrhage has been shown to occur also in the course of traumatic overextension of the spinal column, e.g. in traffic accidents or as a post-mortem artefact in decomposed bodies.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe finding of emission of semen at autopsy is a non-specific finding and does not indicate sexual activity or any particular mode of death.\nThe mere emission of semen found at autopsy does not confirm sexual activity in itself, as post-mortem discharge of semen from the meatus is common in any type of death, not only in asphyxia.\nSolution to Question 25:\nBleeding over the front and sides of the larynx is usually genuine and not a spurious lesion. The following are the spurious haemorrhages that occur:\nThe posterior surface of the oesophagus\nAnterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine\nBanding of the oesophagus - pale areas in the mucosa caused by post-mortem hypostasis.\nArtefactual postmortem haemorrhage on the posterior surface of the oesophagus is called Prinsloo and Gordon artefact.\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe given scenario is an example of burking.\nBurking is a method of homicidal smothering and traumatic asphyxia where the assaulter kneels or sits on the chest (traumatic asphyxia) and close the nose and mouth with his hands (smothering). This was the method of killing performed by William Burke and William Hare.\nImage shows burking\n\nOther options:\nOption B: Smothering is a form of asphyxia that is caused by closing the external respiratory orifices either by the hand or by other means or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by\na foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc. Below image shows smothering\n\nOption C: Traumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the chest, by a heavy substance or object. The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented. There is a gross compression of the chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. For example stampede deaths, crushing by falls of the earth in coal mines, or earthquakes.\nOption D: Overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an infant. The thoracic movements are limited and respiratory exchange is either reduced or completely prevented which leads to death. It is always accidental.\nBelow image below shows overlaying.\n\nDrowning\nQuestion 1:\nWhat does hydrocution refer to?\nPostmortem submersion\nDry lung drowning\nCold water drowning\nElectrocution in water\nQuestion 2:\nA 30-year-old fisherman was brought dead. His autopsy findings revealed emphysema aquosum.

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nHydrocution is the term used for cold water drowning.\nHydrocution/ immersion syndrome refers to sudden death following immersion in cold water. Death results from vagal inhibition of the heart i.e. cardiac arrest occurring due to increased stimulation of the vagus nerve.\nVagus stimulation occurs due to the following mechanisms:\nSudden entry of water into the nasopharynx or larynx\nFalling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especiall the epigastric region\nSudden in-rush of cold water into the ears The types of drowning are:\nWet drowning/ typical drowning\nAtypical drowning/ dry drowning\nImmersion syndrome/ hydrocution\nPost-immersion syndrome/ secondary/ near-drowning\nSubmersion of the unconscious/ shallow-water drowning\nSolution to Question 2:\nEmphysema aquosum is seen in cases of wet drowning.\nOverinflation of the lungs in drowning is known as emphysema aquosum. It is one of the most valuable positive signs of drowning.\nThe oedema fluid in the bronchi blocks the passive collapse that normally occurs at death. Hence, the lungs are held in the inspiratory position. The impression of the ribs on this overinflated lung leaves visible and palpable grooves on the lateral surface.\nAutopsy findings in drowning:\nFroth in the air passages - most useful autopsy sign in drowning. It consists of a proteinaceous exudate and surfactant mixed with the water of the drowning medium.\nWaterlogging of the lung - frothy fluid will exude from the bronchi when the lung is squeezed and from the cut surfaces when they are sectioned with a knife. But, the absence of waterlogging by no means excludes true drowning (e.g. dry drowning).\nEmphysema aquosum - overinflation of the lungs\nPaltauf\u2019s spots - subpleural haemorrhages that reflect haemolysis within intra-alveolar haemorrhages\nDilation of the right heart and great veins - subjective and non-specific finding\nForeign material in the stomach - watery fluid or even foreign material from the water, such as silt, weed or sand\nHemorrhage into the middle ears and into the temporal bone - a positive non-specific sign of drowning\nPresence of fluid in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses - not a reliable diagnostic sign of drowning\nNote: The autopsy findings in drowning are mostly nonspecific and none give conclusive evidence of drowning. The most useful one is froth in the air passages.\nSolution to Question 3:\nAttachment of weights to the body to keep it underwater is consistent with both homicidal and suicidal drowning.\nDifferentiating points:\nSuicidal drowning - determined suicidal person may attach weights to the body or tie his limbs. It is common among women.\nHomicidal drowning - the following additional features may point to a homicidal drowning:\nConstriction/marks around the neck may be present\nEvidence of struggle at the banks of the river from where the body was recovered\nArticles belonging to someone other than the deceased found on the banks of the river associated with those belonging to the deceased\nAccidental drowning is the most common form of drowning. It is seen among fishermen, bathers, dock workers, intoxicated, and epileptics. Homicidal drowning is the least common.\nSolution to Question 4:\nPulmonary edema and cardiac arrest cause death in a case of typical drowning. Death in other types of drowning can be due to:\nDry drowning - laryngeal spasm due to inrush of water\nNear drowning - Hypoxemia leading to sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema\nImmersion syndrome - vagal inhibition causing cardiac arrest\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of immersion syndrome/ hydrocution/ submersion inhibition. Death results from cardiac arrest due to vasovagal inhibition followed by cardiac arrest.\nVagal stimulation occurs due to:\nStimulation of nerve endings of the surface of the body by cold water\nFalling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especiall the epigastric region.\nStimulation of the nerve endings of the mucosa by the entry of cold water into the eardrums, nasal passages, the pharynx, and the larynx.\nThe mechanism involved in immersion syndrome:\nDiving/falling into the water, feet-first\nInexperienced \"duck-diving\"\nDiving/falling into the water with a horizontal entr\nPeople under the influence of alcohol are more likely affected due to the general vasodilation of skin vessels, consequently amplifying the effects of vasovagal inhibition. These effects are increased in people who are attempting suicide/anxious as they have a more active reflex arc.\nOption A: Cerebral edema is seen in cases of near-drowning. It is a type of atypical drowning and is also known as post-immersion syndrome or secondary drowning. This type is necessitated by the survival of the drowning victim beyond 24 hours of a submersion episode. Death is due to respiratory decompensation suffered despite responding well to initial resuscitation measures.\nMechanisms of death involve hypoxemia which results in sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema.\nOption B: Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are the cause of death in typical drowning/primary drowning due to inhalation of water into the lungs. There are varying mechanisms for freshwater\nand saltwater drowning leading to either ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest respectively. Both types of typical drowning have terminal pulmonary edema and heart failure as mechanisms of death.\nOption D: In dry drowning death is due to the development of laryngeal spasm and subsequent airway closure. Thick mucus, foam, and froth may develop, producing a plug.\nSolution to Question 6:\nFreshwater drowning (drowning in a lake) is associated with both hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.\nWhen freshwater (hypotonic to plasma) enters the alveolar spaces, it is rapidly absorbed into the pulmonary circulation resulting in gross local hemodilution. This massive increase in blood volume leads to hemolysis with the liberation of potassium. This causes hyperkalemia with corresponding hyponatremia.\nWhen seawater enters, due to high saline content, reverse osmotic flow occurs. The fluid leaves the circulation and enters the alveolar spaces. This causes hemoconcentration, hypernatremia and pulmonary edema.\nSolution to Question 7:\nGettler's test measures the chloride content of left and right side of the heart.\nA difference of 25 mg% in chloride concentrations between the two sides of the heart is an indication of death due to drowning. This test was used to identify the cause of drowning.\nFreshwater drowning - chloride content of left heart is lower than that of the right heart\nSaltwater drowning - chloride content of right heart is lower than that of the left heart Gettler's claims have been refuted and the test is no longer accepted.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe image given shows the skin maceration or washerwoman's skin. It occurs faster in warm water than in cold water. The signs of immersion are:\nMaceration of skin/ washerwoman's skin - It begins within minutes in warm water and takes longer in cold water. It refers to the wrinkled, pale, and soaked appearance of the skin when immersed in water. This first appears on areas with an appreciable keratin layer such as the fingertips palms, backs of the hands, and later the soles. The first site affected is the fingerpads. It affects the hands earlier than the feet.\nThe image given below shows skin maceration.\n\nCutis anserina - 'goose-flesh' or piloerection: This is usually found in cold water. The image given below shows cutis anserina.\n\nPost-mortem hypostasis - If the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the heads and the limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the abdominal gases.\nForeign bodies in respiratory passages and stomach - Sand may be found deep in the respiratory passages and stomach, especially if the body has been rolled by the waves on a beach. This is not evidence of live aspiration.\nThe signs of immersion just indicate that the body was immersed in water. They are not evidence of death from drowning.\nIn temperate climates, the following is an approximate guide to estimate the duration of immersion:\nFinding\nTime since immersio n\nNo wrinkling of finger pads\nLess than a few hour s\nWrinkled fingers, palms, and feet\nFew hours to 3 days\nEarly decomposition (Head a nd abdomen)",

Recently, other water organisms have been advocated as tests for drowning, including soft-bodied protozoa and crustaceans.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe given image shows a diatom. Postmortem drowning does not show diatoms in the brain tissue.\nDiatoms are microscopic unicellular or colonial algae present in water. As the diatoms are found in both seawater and freshwater, their presence cannot differentiate between freshwater and seawater drowning.\nThe presence of diatoms in the brain tissue is suggestive of antemortem drowning, as only a living person can transport diatoms from the lungs to the viscera via circulation.\nSexual Offences and Abortion\nQuestion 1:\nValid consent for sexual intercourse cannot be given by a girl aged less than:",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nMinimum age of a girl to give consent for sexual intercourse is 18 years.\nThis was changed from 16 years to 18 years by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013.\nSolution to Question 2:\nSection 64 of the BNS (IPC 376) lays down the punishment for the offense of rape.\nSection 64 (1) of the BNS outlines the punishment for rape and section 64 (2) outlines the punishment for rape in custody/rape by a person in a position of authority or trust.\nSection 63 of the BNS (IPC 375) outlines the definition of rape.\nSection 72 of the BNS (IPC 228A) deals with the disclosure of a rape victim's identity. Section 75 of the BNS (IPC 354A) deals with sexual harassment.\nSolution to Question 3:\nStatutory rape is having a sexual relationship with a girl who is below 18 years of age even with her consent.\nSexual intercourse with a woman who is under the influence of sedative drugs like GHB, rohypnol\n(flunitrazepam) is called date rape.\nSexual intercourse with wife living separately, against her consent is marital rape.\nVoluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person who is not their spouse is adultery.\nNote: Adultery used to be a punishable offence under Section 497 IPC. It was scapped down by the Supreme Court on 27th September 2018, and is no longer punishable.\nSolution to Question 4:\nSexual assault by the husband upon his wife during separation is a bailable offense.\nSection 67 of the BNS (376B IPC) deals with sexual intercourse by the husband with his wife during separation. It is cognizable (only on a complaint of the victim) and bailable. Punishment is imprisonment for not less than 2 years but which may extend to 7 years and with a fine.\nSolution to Question 5:\nA person in authority (police constable), who induces or seduces any female (inmate of jail) to have sexual intercourse with him is defined under Section 68 BNS (376C IPC). Such sexual intercourse does not amount to the offense of rape.\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn India, there is no age limit under which a boy is considered physically incapable of committing rape.\nIn such cases, the development of a child along with the development of sexual organs is taken into consideration while deciding if he is capable of performing rape or not. The court decides the question of potency on case to case basis.\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn the case of a young child, the hymen is deeply situated and usually intact after intercourse. As the vagina is very small, it is impossible for the penetration of the adult organ to take place.\nIn children, there are few or no signs of general violence, as the child is unaware of the assault and incapable of resisting. A few indicators for inquiry are:\nPain on urination and/or defecation\nAbdominal pain\nInability to sleep\nSudden withdrawal from peers/adult\nFeelings of anxiety\nNervousne\nHelplessne\nA feeling of ending one\u2019s life\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given findings are suggestive of a false virgin.\nThe examination findings of a separated labia majora, a flabby labia minora, and a fourchette tear are indicative of forceful penetration.\nHymen usually gets ruptured with the first act of sexual intercourse. However, in some cases, hymen remains intact in spite of sexual intercourse. It is indicative of a false virgin.\nSolution to Question 9:\nA vaginal swab of a rape victim demonstrates spermatozoa if the vaginal swab is taken within 72 hours after an assault.\nHowever, a vaginal swab can be taken within 96 hours to demonstrate semen.\nEvidence on the outside of the body and on materials such as clothing can be collected even after 96 hours.\nSolution to Question 10:\nMobile sperms in the vagina can be usually detected up to 6-12 hours after intercourse.\nOnce deposited, the sperms may be recovered up to 72 hours from the vagina but they lose their motility.\nThis evidence is useful in estimating the time of the assault. Venereal diseases and wounds can also be used to estimate time of assault. The absence of spermatozoa in the female genital tract does not rule out the possibility of a sexual assault.\nSpermatozoa can be detected on the body upto 72 hours and semen upto 96 hours, after an assault.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe presence of smegma on the corona glandis indicates that the person has not engaged in a sexual act in the last 24 hours.\nSmegma requires about 24 hours to collect. It gets removed by bathing or washing or intercourse. The absence indicates sexual activity might have been performed in the last 24 hours as it gets rubbed off during intercourse. The presence of smegma absolutely negates the possibility of complete penetration.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe acid phosphatase test is used to identify seminal stains.\nThe prostatic secretion contains acid phosphatase. Semen recovered from the vagina retains acid phosphatase concentrations up to 36 hours after its deposition. It is expressed in Bodansky units. The acid phosphatase test is conclusive in case of the absence of demonstrable sperms or aspermia.\nThe absolute proof of semen is finding at least one unbroken spermatozoon or electrophoretic LDH isoenzyme detection of sperms.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe test done in the scenario is the Barberio test.\nIt is used to detect seminal fluid. When saturated aqueous or alcoholic solution of picric acid is added to the spermatic fluid, yellow needle-shaped rhombic crystals of spermine picrate are\nproduced. Florence test:\nUsed to detect: semen\nStain used: 10% hydrochloric acid and Florence solution (potassium iodide, iodine, and water)\nFinding: If semen is present, dark brown rhombic or needle-shaped crystals of choline iodide appear immediately\nTakayama test (Haemochromogen crystal test):\nUsed to detect: bloodstain\nStain used: Takayama reagent\nFinding: If bloodstain is present, pink feathery crystals of haemochromogen or reduced alkaline haematin appear in a few minute\nTeichmann test (Haemin Crystal Test):\nUsed to detect: bloodstain\nStain used: glacial acetic acid and a small crystal of sodium chloride\nFinding: If bloodstain is present, faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of haemin or haematin chloride appear. When hydrogen peroxide is added, the haematin crystal give bubbles of ga\nSolution to Question 14:\nA funnel-shaped anus is present in the habitual passive agent of sodomy.\nEunuchs are male prostitutes acting as passive agents in sodomy. They belong to 2 groups -\nHijrahs (castrated) and zenanas (with intact genitalia). Examination findings in a habitual passive agent of sodomy:\nShaved anal hair\nFunnel-shaped anu\nDilated and laxed anal sphincter\nAnal fissures and scar\nSmooth anal mucous membrane\nLateral buttock traction test: On applying lateral traction to the buttock, there will usually be a reflex contraction of the anus. But in a habitual passive sodomite, complete relaxation of the phincter occurs.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of fetishistic transvestism.\nIt is a paraphilia characterized by recurrent sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behavior involving the wearing of clothes of the opposite sex and appearing as a member of the opposite sex. It is also called transvestic fetishism. It is usually seen in males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female clothes.\nFetishistic transvestism is a paraphilia whereas transvestism is a gender identity disorder. There is no hormonal/genital abnormality in fetishistic transvestism.\nOption A: Transsexualism refers to an obsessional desire to become a member of the opposite sex and seek surgery for anatomical alterations.\nOption C: Frotteurism refers to a person who obtains sexual gratification by contact with another person (rubbing his private parts against female buttocks, breasts, or thighs, in public places). It is punishable under Sec 292 BNS (Section 290 IPC), with a fine of up to 1000 rupees.\nOption D: Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a person has due to a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. This sense of unease or dissatisfaction can lead to depression and anxiety and can have a harmful impact on daily life.\nSolution to Question 16:\nSexual asphyxia (autoerotic asphyxia/asphyxiophilia) is seen in masochism and transvestism.\nPressure on carotid vessels/partial airway obstruction leads to cerebral hypoxia and impaired consciousness. This causes erotic hallucinations and sexual pleasure. A controlled degree of mechanical asphyxia is produced, but accidental deaths can happen.\nOption A: Lust murder is an extreme case of sadism where murder serves as a stimulus for a sexual act. Death is not accidental, as is in the case of sexual asphyxia.\nOption C: Sexual oralism is obtaining sexual pleasure from the application of the mouth to the sexual organs.\nOption D: Frotteurism is a perversion mostly seen in males, where they obtain sexual gratification from rubbing their genitalia on unsuspecting females.\nSolution to Question 17:\nBNS Section 301 (IPC 297) deals with indignity to the human corpse.\nBNS Sect ion\nIPC secti on\nDeals with\nPunishment",

Abortion cannot be performed at the request of the husband if the woman is not willing.\nWritten consent of the guardian or family is required only when the woman in question is mentally ill or a minor. A diagnosis of autism wouldn't affect the decision-making capacity of the woman.\nSolution to Question 19:\nAs per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) for contraceptive failure is permissible up to 20 weeks. This bill was passed by Rajya Sabha on 17th March 2021.\nFeatures of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill:\nEnhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women which includes survivors of rape, victims of incest, and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors), etc.\nUp to 20 weeks in case of contraception failure\nOpinion of only one provider will be required up to 20 weeks of gestation and of two provider for termination of pregnancy of 20-24 weeks of gestation.\nUpper gestation limit not to apply in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities.\nName and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorized in any law for the time being in force.\nThe ground of failure of contraceptives has been extended to women and their partners.\nSolution to Question 20:\nAs per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, the induction of MTP in a mentally ill woman or a rape victim is allowed until 24 weeks.\nFeatures of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021:\nEnhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women, which includes survivors of rape, victims of incest, and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors).\nOpinion of only one provider will be required up to 20 weeks of gestation and of two provider for termination of pregnancy of 20-24 weeks of gestation.\nUpper gestation limit does not to apply in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities.\nName and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorized in any law for the time being in force.\nThe ground of failure of contraceptives has been extended to women and their partners. Note: The bill was passed by Rajya Sabha on 17th March 2021.\nSolution to Question 21:\nIn the given scenario, you need to start treatment for STI, inform the police, and record refusal of consent for examination.\nExamination of a sexual assault victim shouldn't be forced upon, but an informed refusal is to be documented after explaining to them the consequences of choice.\nMedical treatment and testing for pregnancy have to be done for all victims of sexual assault free of cost and police should be informed as per Section 397 of BNSS (357-C of CrPc).\nAs the girl is under 18 years of age, as per POCSO (The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) act 2012, the medical practitioner should initiate treatment for exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including prophylaxis for identified STDs (including HIV if suspected) and possible pregnancy and emergency contraceptives should be discussed with the victim and her parent/guardian.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe given clinical scenario where one twin is found to not belong to the father of the other twin is suggestive of heteroparental superfecundation.\nSuperfecundation is the fertilization of 2 different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as suggested by the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins.\nThis leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity.\nOption A: Superfetation is the fertilization of 2 different ova released in different menstrual cycles (i.e ovulation and fertilization during pregnancy). This can occur within 12 weeks of pregnancy after which the decidual space is obliterated and a detailed evaluation will reveal disparities in gestational ages.\nOption C: Supposititious child is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman pretends to be pregnant and generally substitutes a male child for a female child born of her, or after an abortion. This is done for the purpose of claiming property.\nOption D: Atavism is the reappearance of a characteristic in an individual after several generations of absence. For example, the child may not resemble his parents but resemble his ancestors. This is attributed to the recombination of genes.\nChildhood Violence, Infanticide and Starvation\nQuestion 1:\nUSG done on a pregnant woman shows Spalding\u2019s sign.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nUSG showing Spalding\u2019s sign is suggestive of maceration of the fetus. This sign refers to the overlapping of the fetal skull bones caused by the collapse of the fetal brain.\nMaceration is a process of aseptic autolysis occurring after the intrauterine death of the fetus. The prerequisite for the process of maceration to occur is that the dead fetus should be in utero for 3-4 days and should be surrounded by the liquor amnii. If air enters the liquor amnii after the death of the fetus, putrefaction occurs instead of maceration.\nNote: Mummification is the term for a dry decomposition of a dead body, or conversion to waxy substances, called adipocere.\nSolution to Question 2:\nRobert\u2019s sign is a radiological sign which refers to the presence of a gas shadow within the chambers of the heart or the greater vessels like aorta. It is seen in cases of foetal death in utero.\nIt is a sign of maceration.\nSolution to Question 3:\nAdipocere formation cannot be an autopsy finding in the given scenario since fetuses under 7 months do not show this change.\nAdipocere is the formation of a soft greyish-white, waxy, greasy material with an offensive, sweet rancid smell, occurring in fatty tissues. It is due to postmortem hydrolysis or hydrogenation of the fats. It is a modification of putrefaction. It is seen most commonly in bodies immersed in water or in a damp, warm environment. Fetuses under 7 months do not show this change.\nIf the pregnancy with the dead fetus continues, it may be gradually resorbed\nor mummified. Mummification occurs when the foetus dies from a deficient supply of blood, when liquor amnii is scanty, and when no air enters the uterus. It is also a finding in fetus papyraceous, which is the intrauterine demise of a fetal twin, where it is compressed between the membranes and the uterine wall.\nThe most important post-mortem change in an intrauterine death is maceration, which is\nan autolytic process by which there is self-disintegration of the body by cellular enzymes. This can occur if the death of the fetus happens days to months before the delivery.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe hydrostatic test is falsely positive in the case of putrefied fetus.\nHydrostatic test is done to determine whether the newborn has respired or not. It is also known as floatation test/ Breslau\u2019s first life test/ Raygat\u2019s test.\nIf the lung pieces float in water, it means that respiration has taken place, indicating a live birth. If the pieces sink, respiration has not taken place, which means it is stillborn.\nAn unrespired lung (stillbirth) may float, giving a false positive test, due to gases of decomposition, as seen in putrefaction.\nSolution to Question 5:\nRule of Haase enables the estimation of the age of the fetus in lunar months from its crown-heel length (in cm).\nAccording to the rule:\nWhen the crown heel length \uf0a3 25 cm, Age in months = Square root of crown heel length\nWhen the crown heel length &gt; 25 cm, Age in months = crown heel length divided by 5\nNote: Haase\u2019s modification of Morrison\u2018s law states that during the last 5 months, the length in centimeters divided by 5 gives the age in months.\nEg : crown heel length = 30 cm, gestaional age = 6 months.\nSolution to Question 6:\nNobbing fracture is a feature of battered baby syndrome (infantile whiplash syndrome).\nIn battered baby syndrome, violent squeezing of the chest from side to side causes fracture of costochondral junctions and fracture along the posterior angles of the rib.\nAfter callus formation, which takes around 2 weeks, it gives a string of beads appearance in paravertebral region on X-ray, also known as nobbing fractures.\nMunchausen syndrome is also known as the factitious disorder imposed on self. Patients deceptively misrepresent, simulate, or cause symptoms of an illness and/or injury in themselves, even in the absence of obvious external rewards such as financial gain, housing, or medications.\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant, which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of battered baby syndrome. The classical feature of this condition is injuries inflicted are of different ages and in different stages of healing. This is due to the repetitive nature of child abuse.\nA battered child is one who has received repetitive physical injuries as a result of\nnon-accidental violence, produced by a parent or guardian, there may also be deprivation of nutrition, care, and affection.\nThis syndrome must be considered in any child:\nIn whom the degree and type of injury varies with the history given\nWhen injuries are of different ages and in different stages of healing\nWhen there is a purposeful delay in seeking medical attention despite serious injury\nWho exhibits evidence of fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, failure to thrive, soft tissue swelling or skin bruising\nWho dies suddenly\nSkeletal survey, which includes the following, should be done in a case of suspected child abuse:\nAP views of the entire skeleton\nDedicated views of hands and feet\nLateral views of appendicular skeleton, skull, and spine\nSolution to Question 8:\nA child who has been physically abused should undergo a thorough physical examination at first. This should be followed by a psychiatric interview.\nWhen the child is brought to the emergency room, a detailed and spontaneous account of the injury should be obtained promptly from parents or other caregivers before secondary details and rationalizations cloud the information provided.\nSolution to Question 9:\nSleeping on hard/ firm surfaces is not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\nCrowded sleeping areas with many pillows, blankets, and stuffed toys, or old, soft mattresses are associated with an increased risk of SIDS.\nSIDS is also known as a 'cot' or 'crib' death. Usually, the parent finds the infant expired in the crib after putting them to sleep. It is an unexpected death in a healthy infant, whose autopsy may not reveal a cause of death.",

    "question_text": "% of cases of SIDS are found at autopsy to have intrathoracic petechiae in the pleura, epicardium, and thymus. However, this feature is considered to be an agonal phenomenon. The presence of this feature alone should not raise concern for manual suffocation.\nMost cases of SIDS occur between 1-7 months of age but can occur up to 2 years. The risk increases with male infants, multiple births, colder climates, and lower socioeconomic status families.\nWays to reduce the risk of SIDS include:\nAvoiding sharing a bed with the infant\nAbstinence from smoking\nUsing hard/firm bedding and keeping the sleeping area clear\nEnsuring the infant sleeps supine\nKeeping the room temperature comfortable\nBreastfeeding\nOption A: Sharing a bed with a family member is associated with SIDS. The risk is augmented if the parent has consumed alcohol or sedative medications.\nOption C: Sleeping prone or on the side is strongly associated with SIDS. The risk of regurgitation and choking is high in infants who sleep prone. These positions are associated with instability.\nOption D: Overheating while sleeping can occur if the baby has a fever or has been placed in excessive clothing or in a warm room. Overheating has been associated with SIDS.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe woman will be punished under BNS Section 103 (IPC 302), which deals with the punishment for murder. This offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to a fine.\nOther relevant sections include:\nBNS Section 93 (IPC 317) - Abandoning a child of &lt;12 years\nBNS Section 94 (IPC 318) - Concealment of birth\nOption A: BNS Section 40 (IPC 102) deals with the commencement and continuance of the private defence of the body.\nOption C: BNS Section 91 (IPC 315) deals with acts done before birth with the intent to prevent a child from being born alive or to cause to die after birth.\nOption D: BNS Section 108 (IPC 306) deals with punishment for abetment to suicide.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe child delivered after the death of the biological father, or a child delivered after the death of the biological mother, usually when delivered by a cesarean section is a posthumous child.\nIllegitimate child is a child born out of wedlock i.e. when the parents are not married.\nSupposititious child or fictitious child is when a woman pretends to go through pregnancy and delivery. Later, she produces a living child as her own for obtaining money or for the purpose of claiming the property.\nSolution to Question 12:\nSexual assault done by a police officer is an aggravated sexual assault according to POCSO\n(Protection of Children from Sexual Offences).\nThe POCSO act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age. It defines various forms of sexual offenses which include:\nSexual harassment - Threatening\nSexual assault - Any act with sexual intent that involves physical contact without penetration.\nAggravated sexual assault - Similar to sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term aggravated\nPenetrative sexual assault - An act with sexual intent that involves physical penetration of the enis or any object into the vagina, mouth, urethra, or anus.\nAggravated penetrative sexual assault - Similar to penetrative sexual assault along with the criteria explained under the term aggravated\nPornography\nThe term aggravated is used for those assaults done:\nBy a person in a position of trust or authority such as a police officer, security force, relative, doctor\nIn the course of communal violence\nOn mentally &amp; physically disabled\nGang sexual assault\nUsing deadly weapons\nCausing grievous hurt\nDepending on if there was penetration or not, it can be aggravated sexual assault (if there is no penetration) or aggravated penetrative sexual assault (if there was penetration). Both are different.\nThe Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life and fine.\nNote- Gang penetrative sexual assault comes under aggravated penetrative sexual assault and not under aggravated sexual assault. Therefore, option C cannot be correct in this case.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe principal has to report this case to the police.\nThe POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law for the protection of children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography. This is done while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation, and speedy trial of the offence through designated special courts.\nSection 21(1) of the POCSO Act, 2012 requires mandatory reporting of cases of child sexual abuse to the law enforcement authorities and applies to everyone including parents, doctors, and school personnel. Failure to report a suspicion of child abuse is an offence under the Act.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn starvation, fat is almost completely absent in the subcutaneous tissues and also in the omentum, mesentery and all the internal organs. This is never seen in wasting diseases.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario points to starvation. In this condition, the gall bladder is distended.\nIn starvation, bile does not get secreted into the duodenum due to the absence of food entering the stomach and intestine. Hence, bile gets accumulated in the gall bladder which gets distended.\nThe feeling of intense hunger lasts for 30\u201348 hours. A person can survive for 10\u201312 days without food and water and for 6\u20138 weeks without food alone.\nLoss of 40% of body weight is usually fatal. Loss of 70\u201390% of body fat and 20% of body protein is fatal. There is a reduction in the weight and size of all organs except the brain.\nPoisoning: General Considerations\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is the science dealing with toxins produced by animals, plants, and microbes called?\nToxicology\nToxology\nToxinology\nEcotoxicology\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following substances are irritant poisons?",

Whereas for an act of homicide with poison, the criminal would like to kill his victim without creating any suspicion in the mind of the victim or people around.\nFollowing are the characteristics of ideal suicidal and homicidal poisons:\nThallium and organic compounds of fluorine satisfy some of the criteria for an ideal homicidal poison.\nArsenic and aconite are commonly used as homicidal poisons but are not considered ideal homicidal poisons.\nNote: Though no single poison would fulfill all the characteristics mentioned in the table given above, a few examples mentioned are often considered.\nCharacteristics\nSuicidal\nHomicidal\nAccessibility to the poison\nEasy and free\nNot particular\nAntidotes availability\nNil\nNil\nClinical diagnosis\nDifficult\nDifficult\nCost of the poison\nCheap\nNot particular\nMetabolism and excretion\nNot particular\nRapid\nOnset of signs and sympto ms\nQuick and fatal\nSlow and fatal\nPostmortem detection\nDifficult\nDifficult\nSigns and symptoms\nNil/ few\nResemble diseases\nSolubility in food/drinks\nPositive\nPositive\nExamples\nOpium, cyanide, barbiturates, organophosphorus compoun ds\nArsenic, aconite, thallium, et c\nSolution to Question 4:\nHe would be charged with Section 286 (IPC 284) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. This section deals with negligent conduct with respect to poisons.\nBNS Section 123 (IPC 328) deals with causing hurt through poison, with intent to commit an offense. In this case, the farmer had no intent of committing any offense and the poisoning was due to negligence. Hence BNS Section 123 does not apply here.\nBNS Section 106 (IPC 304A) deals with causing death by act of negligence. In this case, the farmer's wife suffered poisoning, her death is not mentioned. Hence, BNS Section 106 does not apply here.\nBNS Section 229 (IPC 193) deals with punishment for false evidence.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThis man would be charged with BNS Section 123 (IPC 328) which deals with administering poison/ any stupefying, intoxicating, or unwholesome drug, with the intention of causing hurt or committing an offense.\nOption A: BNS Section 106 (IPC 304A) deals with causing death by negligence.\nOption B: BNS Section 122 (IPC 334) deals with voluntarily causing hurt / grievous hurt on sudden provocation.\nOption D: BNS Section 117 (IPC 322) deals with voluntarily causing grievous hurt.\nSolution to Question 6:\nAll cases of Poisoning, whether suicidal, homicidal or accidental are categorised under Medicolegal cases.\nIn the given clinical scenario, the patient attempts to suicide by poisoning which is labelled as MLC(Medicolegal case) and warrants the need to inform the police. Considering the legal implications, there may be a biased history from relatives or friends or aquaintances; wherein it is always advisable to report each and every suspected case of poisoning to the police and the question of suicide/ homicide/ accident to be considered by the police. The treatment must not be witheld before informing the police.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most rapid onset of action of poison is associated with inhalation in gaseous form/ vapors. Routes of administration in the decreasing order of onset of action are:\nInhalation (most rapid)\nIntravenous\nIntramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal injectio\nApplication to a wound\nApplication to a serous surface\nApplication to a mucous surface\nIngestio\nApplication to unbroken ski\nSolution to Question 8:\nA love philter is a magical potion that is supposed to make the person who receives the potion love the one who gave it. These are usually aphrodisiacs.\nSome aphrodisiacs that are used as love philter are:\nCantharides\nArsenic\nAlcohol\nOpium\nCocaine\nCannabis\nThe use of a love philter might lead to accidental poisoning.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe chocolate-brown discoloration which does not blanch on pressure is suggestive of postmortem hypostasis/ lividity. It usually develops within 4 hours and persists until putrefaction.\nChocolate-coloured post-mortem lividity is associated with nitrates, nitrites, aniline, bromates, chlorates. It is due to the formation of methemoglobin.\nToxicity from nitrates can be treated with methylene blue to reverse the formation of methemoglobin.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThis scenario is suggestive of phosphorus poisoning as it is associated with a garlic-like odor, usually around the mouth and nose of the victim.\nOther substances associated with a garlic-like odor are arsenic, thallium carbonate, and zinc phosphide.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe area marked in image 2 depicts the most likely pattern of gastric mucosal injury in this patient.\nThe pathway that fluids (acid, alkali, water) take in a food-filled stomach is known as magenstrasse. It is present along the lesser curvature of the stomach. This is where the greatest damage to gastric mucosa takes place, in corrosive injury.\n\nIn an empty stomach, the maximum injury occurs to the lower half to two-thirds of the body, with sparing of the fundus (image 3).\nSolution to Question 12:\nIn sodium amytal poisoning, the capsules stain the stomach mucosa and its contents, turquoise blue. Bluish discolouration of the stomach mucosa is also seen in copper sulphate poisoning.\nThe appearance of the gastric mucosa in specific poisons:\nPoison\nAppearance of Gastric Mucos a\nArsenic\nRed velvety mucosa\nPoison\tAppearance of Gastric Mucos a\nPoison\tAppearance of Gastric Mucos a\nSulphuric acid\nBrown or black with erosion perforation and Carbonizatio\nCarbolic acid\nGrey leathery and thickened mucosa\nHNO3\nYellow\nHCN\nPink\nKCN\nBrick red to brown\nPhosphorous\nYellow or grey white\nSodium amytal, Copper sulp hate\nBlue\nSolution to Question 13:\nCNS depressants and alcohol are associated with the phenomenon of drug automatism.\nDrug automatism develops due to the depressant effect of these drugs. It leads to the development of an 'automatism state', where the patient takes additional doses of the drug, without realizing it. This can lead to accidental poisoning.\nSolution to Question 14:\nGastric lavage can be performed in case of carbolic poisoning.\nIn carbolic acid poisoning, if the patient survives for 48 hrs, there will be carboluria followed by anuria. The victim will pass dark, smoky urine which soon turns olive green on standing due to oxidation of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol.\nIt is a corrosive acid, however, it hardens the GI mucosa producing a leather bottle stomach and anesthetizes the nerve endings. This allows for gastric lavage.\nContraindications of gastric lavage:\nCorrosives poisoning (except carbolic acid)\nConvulsants/CNS stimulants\nComatose patients\nVolatile poiso\nUpper GI pathology (eg. esophageal varices)\nHypothermic patient\nSevere heart disease\nAdvanced pregnancy\nSulphuric acid and kerosene are corrosives and strychnine is a convulsant. Hence gastric lavage is not done in these poisonings.\nSolution to Question 15:\nGastric lavage is not done in a case of kerosene poisoning. It can cause aspiration and pneumonitis.\nGastric lavage is rarely indicated as the procedure has numerous complications. It may be considered in cases where there is recent (&lt;1 hour) ingestion of life-threatening amounts of a toxin, for which there is no treatment once absorbed.\nWith drugs that slow down gastrointestinal motility or cause pylorospasm (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids, salicylates), lavage can be done up to 24 hours.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe left lateral position is the ideal position for performing gastric lavage.\nPosition the patient on the left side with the head down at an angle of 20 degrees. The patient's mouth should be at a lower level than the larynx, to prevent aspiration.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe tube used for performing gastric lavage is an Ewald tube. It is also known as Boa's tube, stomach tube, or orogastric lavage tube.\n\nGastric lavage is the administration and evacuation of small volumes of liquid through an orogastric tube to remove toxic substances within the stomach. In adults, small amounts of warm water or saline are administered and, via a siphoning action, removed again. In children, normal saline is used, as children are more at risk of developing hyponatremia if lavaged with water.\nIn an unconscious patient, gastric lavage is performed after induction of general anesthesia with the patient intubated, to prevent aspiration.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe next best step in the management of the patient with suspected poisoning is to either administration an antidote or enhanced the elimination of the poison.\nThe following modalities of gastrointestinal decontamination have been used in the past but are no longer routinely recommended:\nEmetics\nCathartics\nDilution was historically recommended following the ingestion of acidic or alkaline corrosives to decrease the concentration and prevent tissue damage.\nGastric lavage is rarely indicated and is associated with high rates of complications.\nSolution to Question 19:\nActivated charcoal is not effective in case of poisoning with heavy metals like lead, corrosives, cyanide, hydrocarbons, and alcohol.\nIndications for use of activated charcoal:\nIngestion within the previous 1 hour [except in cases of poisons that slow gastric emptying (anticholinergics) or after ingestion of a substance that leads to bezoar formation (salicylates), it may be given after one hour]\nThe toxic substance should be known to be adsorbed by activated charcoal\nThe benefits of administration should outweigh the risks Contraindications to use of activated charcoal:\nNon-toxic ingestio\nToxin not adsorbed by activated charcoal\nUnprotected airway\nPossibility of upper GI perforatio\nSolution to Question 20:\nMultidose activated charcoal (MDAC) is used for the enhanced elimination of a toxin.\nIn some instances, patients may benefit from the repeated administration of activated charcoal. MDAC facilitates the passage of substances from plasma into the intestinal lumen, enhancing elimination. Currently, MDAC is indicated for only the following poisons:\nCarbamazepine\nTheophylline\nPhenobarbital\nSalicylates\nDapsone\nQuinine\nThe techniques used for general management of poisoning can be classified into\nMechanism\nTechniques\nGastrointestinal decontamina tion\nOrogastric lavageActivated ch arcoalWhole bowel irrigation\nEnhanced elimination\nMulti-dose activated charcoal Urinary alkalinizationExtraco rporeal removal (Hemodialys is, Hemoperfusion)\nAdministration of antidote\nMechanical antidotesChemic al antidotesPhysiological anti dotesPharmacological antidot es\nSolution to Question 21:\nDimercaprol (BAL) is an antidote for gold, arsenic (except arsine), or acute mercury poisoning (except non-alkyl mercury). It is also an adjunct to edetate calcium disodium in acute lead poisoning.\nDimercaprol has also been approved by the FDA to treat Wilson's disease but not acute copper poisoning. The use of dimercaprol in the management of poisoning for other heavy metals has not been validated.\nNote: Mnemonic: B.A.L. for M.A.L. (Mercury, arsenic, and lead).\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of lead poisoning. Calcium EDTA and DMSA\n(succimer) are the preferred antidotes for lead poisoning.\nIn a patient highly exposed to lead, chelation with oral DMSA (succimer) is recommended.\nIn case of acute poisoning with encephalopathy, IV or IM Calcium EDTA is given along with dimercaprol. Calcium EDTA redistributes lead to the brain and increases the risks of leading to encephalopathy, which is prevented by dimercaprol.\nSolution to Question 23:\nUrinary alkalinization (forced alkaline diuresis) is most effective for weak acids, primarily eliminated by the renal tract. It is performed with sodium bicarbonate.\nAcetazolamide should not be used to produce alkaline urine, because it may worsen toxicity by causing a concomitant systemic acidosis. It results in an increase in the amount of the unionized drug in the blood and enhanced tissue distribution. It may also compete with acidic drugs for tubular secretion and thereby inhibit their elimination.\nDrugs most commonly treated with forced alkaline diuresis are salicylates and phenobarbital.\nSolution to Question 24:\nForced acidic diuresis is not indicated in any scenario as its potential risks (such as rhabdomyolysis, acute renal injury) outweigh any potential benefits.\nNote: Though some books say that acidic diuresis is indicated in few poisoning, it is only theoretic. Forced acidic diuresis is never indicated due to the associated risks.\nSolution to Question 25:\nHemoperfusion uses adsorbents like a charcoal filter, which comes into direct contact with blood, partially overcoming molecular weight and protein-binding limitations.\nProperties of toxins to be considered for hemodialysis and hemoperfusion:\nHemodialysis\nHemoperfusion\nToxin requireme nts\nLow volume of distributionL ow protein bindingLow endo genous clearanceLow molecu lar weight\nLow volume of distributionL ow endogenous clearanceBou nd by activated charcoal\nIndications\nSalicylatesLithiumAlcoholsM etformin\nTheophyllineCarbamazepine\nOrganophosphorus Poisoning\nQuestion 1:\nPoisoning with which of the following compounds causes mydriasis?\nDiazinon\nPhosdrin\nEndrin\nParaoxon\nQuestion 2:\nA 36-year-old woman presents to the casualty with diarrhea, miosis, and altered sensorium. Her husband reveals that she has ingested rat poison in an attempt to commit suicide. What is the likely mechanism that is responsible for her clinical presentation?\nInhibition of acetylcholinesterase\nCarbamylation of carboxylic esterase\nOxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin\nFree radical mediated damage\nQuestion 3:\nW ich of the following statements is false regarding the clinical syndromes seen in patients with organophosphate poisoning?\nCNS symptoms can be seen in acute toxicity\nIntermediate syndrome can be treated with atropine\nChronic toxicity can manifest as symmetrical sensorimotor axonopathy\nMuscle wasting can be seen in organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy\nQuestion 4:\nA 25-year-old woman, who was admitted with accidental rodenticide ingestion, was started on atropine. All of the following symptoms would improve in response to therapy except:\nBradycardia\nUrinary incontinence\nMuscle cramps\nHypotension\nQuestion 5:\nA local informer revealed that decades-old nerve gas cylinders were being smuggled across the border. On arrival of the police at the crime scene, the accused opened fire. One of the bullets accidentally impaled the canister near the police officer. Which of the following symptoms would you expect to see in him?\nHallucinations\nMiosis\nChest pain\nJoint pain\nQuestion 6:\nA 45-year-old woman, who is being treated for organophosphate poisoning with atropine, is started on pralidoxime. Which of the following symptoms would regress due to the action of pralidoxime alone?\nMiosis\nTongue fasciculations\nAbdominal cramps\nHypotension\nQuestion 7:\nW ich of the following statements is true about the intermediate syndrome in organophosphorus poisoning?\nSigns of cholinergic excess are seen\nThere is no specific treatment\nThere is weakness of neck extensors\nRespiratory failure is not a complication\nQuestion 8:\nA 38-year-old gardener presents with blurred vision, breathlessness, and muscle fasciculations. He gives a history of spraying the solution given in the image a day prior to his symptoms. All of the following are specific indicators of the likely diagnosis except:\n\nProlonged QTc interval\nMiosis and muscle fasciculations\nResolution of cholinergic symptoms upon atropine administration\nFall in RBC cholinesterase levels\nQuestion 9:\nYou are suspecting organophosphorus poisoning in a farmer who presented with chronic fatigue and urinary incontinence. What would be the most accurate investigation to assess potential toxicity?\nPlasma cholinesterase\nRBC cholinesterase\nSerum levels of organophosphorus compounds\nUrinary levels of organophosphorus compound metabolites\nQuestion 10:\nIn organophosphorus poisoning, clinical manifestations occur when pseudocholinesterase levels fall below:",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nEndrin is an organochlorine compound. Poisoning with this compound causes mydriasis. There is no specific antidote for organochlorine poisoning.\nDiazinon, phosdrin, and paraoxon are organophosphates and they cause miosis. Organophosphate poisoning is treated with atropine and oximes.\nClassification of insecticides:\nOrganophosphorus compounds\nParathion\nParaoxon\nChlorthion\nDiazinon\nMalathion\nPhosdrin\nHETP (hexaethyl tetraphosphate)\nTEPP (tetraethyl pyrophosphate)\nOrganochlorine compounds\nDDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane)\nGammahexa-chlorobenzene\nEndrin\nAldrin\nEndosulfan\nCarbamates\nAldicarb\nCarbaryl\nCarbofuran\nPyrethrin and pyrethroids\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of organophosphorus (OP) poisoning. Clinical effects are due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.\nInhibition of cholinesterase leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine at the nerve synapses and neuromuscular junctions. This results in overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors resulting in a cholinergic crisis.\nThe types of cholinesterases are:\nAcetylcholinesterase or RBC cholinesterase is helpful in the diagnosis of OP poisoning but has no prognostic significance.\nIt is hypothesized that inhibition of neuropathy target esterase enzyme may be responsible for organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN).\nThe mechanism of action of the other agricultural poisons are:\nType\nLocation\nAcetylcholinesterase or true o r RBC cholinesterase\nRBC membranesNervous tiss ueSkeletal muscle\nButyrylcholinesterase or plas ma cholinesterase or pseudoc holinesterase\nSerumLiverPancreasHeartBr ain\nNeuropathy target esterase\nBrainKidney\nCompound\nMechanism of action\nCarbamates\nCarbamylation of carboxylic esterase\nChlorate salts(sodium or pota ssium chlorates)\nOxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin\nParaquat\nFree radical-mediated damag e\nSolution to Question 3:\nIntermediate syndrome is unresponsive to atropine and oximes. The syndrome occurs due to prolonged cholinesterase inhibition and muscle necrosis. Maintenance of nutrition, physiotherapy, prevention of bed sores and other routine measures to minimise discomfort along with ventilatory care are management options.\nFour clinical syndromes are identified with respect to organophosphate exposure. They include:\nAcute poisoning - This results in CNS, muscarinic, nicotinic, and somatic motor manifestations.\nIntermediate syndrome - It is usually observed 1-5 days after OP exposure. It is characterized by paralysis of neck flexors, muscles innervated by cranial nerves, proximal limb muscles, and respiratory muscles.\nChronic toxicity - It is seen primarily in agricultural workers with daily exposure. It manifests as symmetrical sensorimotor axonopathy.\nOrganophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy - This is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy. It can lead to flaccid paralysis and muscle wasting.\nSolution to Question 4:\nAtropinization in organophosphate (rodenticide) poisoning does not cause regression of nicotinic symptoms like muscle cramps. Hence, oximes are used for the reversal of nicotinic symptoms.\nAtropine is effective against muscarinic receptors. It can be used to treat muscarinic symptoms like bradycardia, urinary incontinence, and hypotension.\nSolution to Question 5:\nNerve gases are organophosphate compounds in the gaseous form. It manifests with cholinergic signs and symptoms, such as miosis. It was used in chemical warfare.\nThe nerve gases include:\nSoman\nSarin\nTabun\nVX\nSolution to Question 6:\nPralidoxime causes reversal of tongue fasciculations (nicotinic symptoms).\nSince atropine does not bind to nicotinic receptors, it is ineffective in treating neuromuscular dysfunction. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) and other oximes, such as HI-6 and obidoxime, are cholinesterase-reactivating agents. Hence, its coadministration with atropine is effective in treating both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms.\nPralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied. Then it reacts with the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorous compound which is attached to the esteric site to form a phospho-oxime complex. It then dissociates from the enzyme, regenerating the active enzyme.\nPralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms due to transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition.\nNote: Muscle cramps are nicotinic symptoms. However, abdominal cramps are muscarinic symptoms.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThere is no specific treatment for the intermediate syndrome in organophosphate (OP) poisoning.\nThe intermediate syndrome is seen in 20-50% of acute OP poisoning cases. This syndrome develops one to several days after the poisoning, during the recovery from cholinergic manifestations. In some cases, it can occur when patients have completely recovered from the\ninitial cholinergic crisis.\nClinical features include paralysis of:\nNeck flexor muscles\nMuscles innervated by the cranial nerves\nProximal limb muscles\nRespiratory muscles - respiratory support may be needed Symptoms or signs of cholinergic excess are absent in this syndrome.\nThere is no specific treatment for the intermediate syndrome and intervention is exclusively supportive.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of malathion (organophosphate) poisoning. In this condition, prolonged QTc interval is a non-specific finding. However, it correlates with the severity and mortality in severe cases.\nThe reliable indicators of OP poisoning are:\nMiosis and muscle fasciculations\nDecrease in RBC cholinesterase levels\nAbsence/ resolution of cholinergic symptoms after an initial dose of atropine\nSolution to Question 9:\nRBC cholinesterase enzyme activity is the most accurate indicator to assess potential organophosphorus (OP) toxicity. It is an indicator of synaptic cholinesterase inhibition.\nHowever, plasma butyrylcholinesterase is easier to assay and more easily available. Hence, it is more commonly used.\nMeasurement of parent compound in blood and metabolites urine are rarely carried out in a clinical setting.\nNote: The correlation between cholinesterase activity, clinical symptoms, and atropine dose is inconsistent. Hence, treatment should be guided predominately by clinical symptoms.\nSolution to Question 10:\nIn organophosphorus poisoning, clinical signs and symptoms are observed when pseudocholinesterase level falls below 50% of normal.\nSeverity of symptoms correlates with pseudocholinesterase levels:\nRBC cholinesterase enzyme activity is the most accurate indicator to assess potential organophosphorus toxicity. However, plasma butyrylcholinesterase is easier to assay and more easily available. Hence, it is more commonly used.\nSeverity of OP poisonin g\nLevels of pseudocholinestera se\nMild",

Clear chest on auscultation indicates clearing of tracheobronchial secretions and cessation of bronchoconstriction. Hence, it is considered as the therapeutic endpoint of atropinization.\nTachycardia and mydriasis are not appropriate markers for therapeutic improvement, as they may indicate continued hypoxia, hypovolemia, or sympathetic stimulation.\nTreatment of organophosphorus poisoning:\nDecontamination\nAirway management\nStomach wash - water with or without KMnO4\nAtropine sulphate at a dose of 2-4 mg IV - highly effective in counteracting the peripheral muscarinic effects and antagonize CNS effects at higher doses\nOximes - used early as they have more pronounced action on nicotinic sites\nSolution to Question 12:\nOxygen supplementation has proven clinical and mortality benefits in patients with organophosphate (OP) poisoning who develop respiratory failure.\nPralidoxime is not beneficial in terms of reducing mortality, need for ventilator support, and incidence of intermediate syndrome. Despite theoretical and experimental benefits and clinical use worldwide, the current evidence is inadequate. However, until further research has been undertaken, all patients poisoned with organophosphorus agents are recommended to be treated with an oxime.\nUrinary alkalinization, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion have no role in the treatment of OP poisoning.\nNote: Gastric lavage and activated charcoal administration are beneficial only in patients who present within 2 hours following ingestion of OP compounds.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe most common cause of death in organophosphate poisoning is respiratory failure. It usually occurs within 24 hours in untreated patients, secondary to paralysis of respiratory muscles.\nSolution to Question 14:\nCarbamates can also lead to the intermediate syndrome.\nOption A: Carbamate-cholinesterase bond undergoes rapid, spontaneous hydrolysis which leads to regeneration of the enzyme within a few hours. This is called reversible carbamylation.\nHence, aging (conversion of the inhibited enzyme into a non-reactivable form) does not occur and the effect of carbamate toxicity is of a shorter duration.\nOption C: Carbamates do not effectively penetrate the CNS in adults. Hence, there is less CNS toxicity.\nOption D: Pralidoxime is contraindicated in carbamate poisoning because it may potentiate the toxicity of carbamates due to its transient oxime-induced cholinesterase inhibition.\nCorrosives and Asphyxiants\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following pairs of corrosives and their mechanism of action is incorrect?\nCarbolic acid - Coagulation necrosis\nAmmonia - Liquefactive necrosis\nHydrofluoric acid - Liquefactive necrosis\nSodium hydroxide - Coagulation necrosis\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following statements regarding upper GI involvement in corrosive poisoning is true?\nWith acids, involvement of the esophagus is more than the stomach\nWith alkali, involvement of the stomach is more than the esophagus\nWith acids, involvement of the esophagus and stomach is roughly equa\nWith alkali, there is more superficial injury than with acids\nQuestion 3:\nWhich of the following is not contraindicated in patients with caustic esophageal injury?\nEndoscopy within 12 hrs\nEmetics for gastrointestinal decontamination\nNeutralizing agents\nNasogastric intubation\nQuestion 4:\nIn which of the following conditions will you use calcium gluconate for management in an emergency?",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nSodium hydroxide is a strong alkali. It is associated with liquefactive necrosis.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe involvement of the esophagus and stomach with acid ingestion is roughly similar on endoscopy.\nAcids cause more superficial injury, due to eschar formation which prevents penetration of acid. In contrast, alkalis cause deeper injury.\nAlkali ingestion causes more damage to the esophagus than to the stomach or duodenum.\nSolution to Question 3:\nEndoscopy within 12 hrs is not contraindicated in patients with caustic esophageal injury. Endoscopy done after 24 hrs increases tissue friability.\nAgents and procedures contraindicated in caustic ingestions are :\nGastric lavage and administration of activated charcoa\nUse of emetics - because vomiting will result in repeat exposure of the airway and GI mucosa to the caustic agent and may precipitate perforation\nNeutralization and dilution therapy - There is no proven benefit. Additionally, neutralization of the acid with sodium bicarbonate will lead to the production of carbon dioxide, leading to gastric distension and the risk of perforation.\nNasogastric intubation - This is done blindly and has the potential to exacerbate potential airway injuries.\nNote: Oral intubation with direct visualization is the first choice for definitive airway management.\nSolution to Question 4:\nCalcium gluconate is used in the management of hypocalcemia(in oxalic acid and hydrofluoric acid poisoning), and cardiotoxicity(in hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia).\nCalcium gluconate is not used in the management of hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe autopsy finding of leather bottle appearance of gastric mucosa is characteristic of carbolic acid (phenol) poisoning.\nLeather bottle appearance refers to the hardening of the gastric wall. Therefore, gastric lavage can be done in phenol poisoning unlike other corrosives where gastric lavage is contraindicated.\nNote : Sulphuric acid produces a blotting paper appearance of gastric mucosa.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given image shows olive green colored urine which is known as carboluria. It is seen after ingestion of carbolic acid.\nIn carbolic acid poisoning, if the patient survives for 48 hrs, there will be carboluria followed by anuria. Carboluria is due to oxidation of hydroquinone and pyrecatechol on exposure to air.\nSolution to Question 7:\nTongue turns jet black in color after contact with sulphuric acid. Yellowing of tissue is found with nitric acid. (Xanthoproteic reaction).\nCharacteristics of sulphuric acid poisoning:\nTissues turn jet black in color, except teeth which are chalky white\nOn autopsy, the stomach has a blotting paper-like consistency\nMost commonly associated with perforation of the stomach\nThe mind remains clear till death\nFatal dose: 5-10m\nFatal period: 12-24 hours.\nSulphuric acid is the most common substance associated with vitriolage. Vitriolage is the throwing of sulphuric acid on another individual.\nSolution to Question 8:\nSulphuric acid is not linked to section 80 BNS (304B IPC). Chemicals in toxicology and their relevant IPCs:\nOxalic acid - used to remove writing, erase signatures and forgery. Section 335 BNS (463 IPC) defines making a false document whereas section 336 BNS deals with forgery.\nSulphuric acid - the most common substance used for vitriolage. Vitriolage is covered under Section 124 BNS (326A of IPC) - voluntarily causing grievous hurt by the use of acid.\nThallium - ideal homicidal poison. Any case of suspected homicidal poisoning that is brought to the attention of a doctor should be mandatorily reported under Section 33 BNSS (39 CrPC).\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given image shows the characteristic boiled lobster appearance. It is seen in poisoning with boric acid.\nIn severe poisoning with boric acid, a beefy red skin rash, most often affecting palms, soles, buttocks, and scrotum, is seen. The intense erythema is followed by extensive exfoliation.\nBoric acid is used as an antiseptic and insecticide.\nSolution to Question 10:\nHelium is classified as a simple asphyxiant.\nAn asphyxiant is a toxic or non-toxic gas which causes respiratory embarrassment and leads to unconsciousness or death by asphyxiation.\nAsphyxiants can be classified into:\nAsphyxiant\nDescription\nExamples\nSimple Asphyxiants\nInert gases that displace oxyg en\nNoble gasesCarbon dioxideH ydrocarbons\nChemical Asphyxia nts\nReduce the body's ability to a bsorb, transport or utilize ox ygen\nCarbon monoxideCyanideHy drogen sulphide\nIrritant Asphyxiant s\nDamage the respiratory tract\nAmmoniaFormaldehydeMeth yl isocyanate\nAsphyxiant\nDescription\nExamples\nSystemic Asphyxia nts\nProduce significant sytemic t oxicity by specialized mechan isms\nCarbon monoxideCyanide\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe bright red post mortem staining is seen in cyanide toxicity. It is associated with histotoxic hypoxia.\nHistotoxic hypoxia in cyanide toxicity is due to its inhibition of complex IV of ETC (cytochrome oxidase a3).\nToxins that inhibit complex IV of electron transport chain include:\nCyanide\nCarbon monoxide\nHydrogen sulfide.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe ingestion of peach seeds can cause cyanide poisoning. It is due to the presence of amygdalin in its seeds.\nOption B: The bitter almond odor associated with cyanide poisoning can only be detected by 60% of the population. The ability to detect this odor is an x-linked recessive trait.\nOption C: Cyanides are less effective in persons suffering from achlorhydria (since HCl acts on cyanides to liberate hydrocyanic acid)\nOption D: Cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase (Complex IV) in the ETC, not cytochrome reductase (Complex III).\nSolution to Question 13:\nBehr hereditary optic neuropathy is not associated with chronic cyanide toxicity. Eye manifestations in chronic cyanide toxicity:\nTobacco amblyopia:\nOccurs predominantly in male cigarette smokers\nManifests as progressive visual loss\nResults from an inherent inability to detoxify cyanide\nTropical ataxic Neuropathy (TAN):\nA demyelinating condition\nAssociated with excessive cassava consumption\nLeber's hereditary optic Neuropathy:\nGradual loss of central vision\nOccurs due to a defect in cyanide metabolism.\nDeficiency of rhodanese is one proposed mechanism.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn deaths due to cyanide poisoning, rigor mortis sets in early and persists longer.\nOption A: In case of suspected cyanide poisoning, cranial cavity should be opened first as the odor of bitter almonds is well marked in the brain tissue.\nOption B: Spleen is said to be the best specimen for cyanide analysis, since it has the highest concentration of the poison owing to its presence of RBCs.\nOption C: The basal ganglia are particularly sensitive to cyanide toxicity. Basal ganglia injury may be due to either direct cellular injury or secondary to hypoxic effects.\nSolution to Question 15:\nHydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate are the preferred antidotes in cyanide toxicity.\nIf hydroxocobalamin is available, give hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate.\nIf hydroxocobalamin is not available, give amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate. Avoid nitrites if the patient has contraindications to nitrites.\nHydroxocobalamin is preferred over sodium nitrite as it does not interfere with the\noxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Also, sodium nitrite can induce fatal methemoglobinemia in patients who are critically ill from another cause.\nMechanism of action of antidotes:\nDicobalt EDTA can also bind cyanide, but it causes severe side effects.\nMechanism of antidote\nExample\nBinding of cyanide\nDirect binding of cyanide, fo owed by clearance\nHydroxocobalamin\nInduction of methemoglobin emia\nWhen cyanide binds methem oglobin, a relatively less toxic cyanomethemoglobin is for med\nSodium nitriteAmyl nitrit e\nMechanism of antidote\nExample\nUse of sulfur donors\nThis involves maximizing the availability of sulfur donors f or rhodanese, a ubiquitous e nzyme that detoxifies cyanide by transforming it to thiocya nate\nSodium thiosulfate\nSolution to Question 16:\nCurve C indicates poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO).\nCO binds to hemoglobin and prevents O2 binding (therefore the decrease in the Vmax).\nCO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity that is 250 times that of O2 to form carboxyhemoglobin. This means that when the partial pressure of CO is only 1/250 that of O2, equal amounts of CO and O2 will bind to hemoglobin. Thus, the hemoglobin that can now bind to O2 is reduced to 50% causing a reduction in the graph's height.\nCO also increases the O2 affinity of remaining free hemoglobin sites which causes a left shift of the O2 - hemoglobin dissociation curve.\nCurve A - Myoglobin O2-dissociation curve (Myoglobin has a higher affinity towards O2 than hemoglobin. Hence, it shows a hyperbolic curve with a left shift)\nCurve B - Normal Hb O2-dissociation curve Curve D - Curve showing anemia\nSolution to Question 17:\nRebound effect in carbon monoxide poisoning is due to binding of carbon monoxide to myoglobin.\nAbout 15% of CO present in extracellular tissues combines with myoglobin. A rebound effect with delayed return of symptoms is due to late release of CO from myoglobin with subsequent binding to hemoglobin.\nSolution to Question 18:\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is fatal above carboxyhemoglobin levels of 60%. Normal carboxyhemoglobin levels:",

It is characteristic of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nSolution to Question 20:\nSoftening of the basal ganglia is a characteristic postmortem finding in case of carbon monoxide poisoning.\nSoftening of basal ganglia is seen in:\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\nCyanide poisoning\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe patient is most likely suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning due to the usage of generators indoors. Hoppe-Seyler's test can be used for the diagnosis of CO poisoning.\nTests that may be used for the diagnosis of CO poisoning:\nHoppe-Seyler's test\nKunkel's test\nSpectroscopy\nPotassium ferricyanide test\nKatayama's test.\nOption A: Pulse oximetry should never be used to evaluate CO poisoning as a standard pulse oximeter cannot distinguish between oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.\nOption C: An arterial blood gas analysis will show no decrease in the levels of dissolved oxygen, as this is not affected by CO. CO decreases the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin but has no effects on oxygen dissolved in plasma.\nOption D: CT brain in a case of CO poisoning shows necrosis of the globus pallidus.\nNote: Never use gasoline-powered electrical generators indoors, even if windows and doors are open. CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can kill without warning.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Food (especially fats and proteins) decreases absorption.\nThe following factors enhance absorption of alcohol:\nEmpty stomach\nStrength of alcohol drink\nCarbonated drinks - the bubbles greatly increase the surface area carrying alcoho\nWarm alcohol drinks - warm drinks dilate gastric mucosal capillaries and are quickly absorbed\nSolution to Question 3:\nThere are no significant gender differences concerning renal elimination affecting the Blood Alcohol Concentration(BAC) levels.\nBAC following the ingestion of ethanol is influenced by many factors. These include:\nWeight - Women on average are smaller than men, so have less fluid in their bodies for alcoho distribution\nBody fat percentage - Since women have greater body fat, their aqueous compartment is smaller and hence they achieve a higher BAC.\nGastric alcohol dehydrogenase - Some ethanol is broken down in the stomach by gastric alcoho dehydrogenase, which lowers the amount available for absorption. This enzyme is present at higher levels in men than in women.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of McEwan's sign.\nPupils are contracted, but stimulating the person (e.g., pinching or slapping) causes them to dilate, with a slow return. This is a characteristic finding of ethanol toxicity, seen at BAC levels &gt;250 mg%.\nSolution to Question 5:\nTremors/ Tremulousness or 'shakes' or 'jitters' is the most common sign of alcohol withdrawal. This occurs about 6-8 hours after their last drink.\nEffects of alcohol withdrawal include:\nWeakness\nTremors\nInsomnia\nLoss of appetite\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nRestlessness\nExaggerated reflexes\nFluctuating blood pressure\nHallucinations\nSolution to Question 6:\nSnowfield vision is seen in methanol poisoning. Consumption of excess alcohol is associated with:\nHoliday heart syndrome:\nSeen after an episode of heavy drinking\nPresents with cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmia).\nMarchiafava-Bignami syndrome:\nCaused by widespread demyelination of the corpus callosum, optic tracts, and cerebellar peduncles.\nCharacterized by disorientation, epilepsy, ataxia, dysarthria, hallucinations, spastic limb paralysis, personality, and intellectual deterioration.\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by:\nWernicke's encephalopathy - nystagmus, ophthalmoparesis, confusion, and ataxia\nKorsakoff psychosis - memory loss and confabulation.\nSolution to Question 7:\nIn isolated ethanol intoxication, the occurrence of horizontal gaze nystagmus indicates a BAC level of around 80 mg/dl. It has a 70-80% sensitivity.\nHorizontal gaze nystagmus has been shown to correlate highly with both BAC and cognitive impairment.\nThe HGN test assesses lack of smooth pursuit, sustained endpoint nystagmus, and induced nystagmus prior to a lateral gaze angle of 45 degrees.\nBAC levels corresponding to the clinical features are:\nBlood alcohol concentratio n\nEffects",

The tests used for estimation of alcohol concentration can be classified as follows:\nTest\nExample\nChemical\nWidmark methodCavett m ethod\nBiochemi cal\nADH method\nPhysical\nGas-Liquid Chromatograph y\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe most accurate breath analyzers work based on the principle of infrared spectrophotometry.\nInfrared spectroscopy is the measurement of the interaction of infrared radiation with the matter by absorption, emission, or reflection.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThis man can be charged under Sec 86 IPC (Sec 24 BNS).\nAccording to this section, an act is considered a crime only if done with certain knowledge or intent, a person who commits the act while intoxicated will be assumed to have had that knowledge as if they were not intoxicated. This assumption does not apply if the person was intoxicated without their knowledge or against their will.\nOption A: Section 84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) - Act of a person of unsound mind\u2014No act is an offence which is undertaken by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or understanding of what is being done is either wrong or contrary to law. This does not apply to the man, who was not of unsound mind. Section 84 IPC (Sec 22 BNS) does apply in the case of delirium tremens.\nSection 85 IPC (Sec 23 BNS)- No act is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of intoxication, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law; provided that what intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. Here, Section 85 IPC (Sec 23 BNS) does not\napply because the alcohol was not administered to him against his will.\nOption C: Section 510 IPC (Sec 355 BNS) - Misconduct by a drunken person in public is punishable with imprisonment of up to 24 hours. This does not apply here as the man was not caught committing the crime while in a state of intoxication.\nSolution to Question 11:\nMetadoxine enhances the metabolism of alcohol. It is reported to double the rate at which ethanol blood levels decrease with time compared with the patient\u2019s own metabolism.\nIt is not yet approved by the FDA for use in acute ethanol intoxication, and its use should be considered experimental.\nSolution to Question 12:\nHooch tragedy may occur due to consumption of cheap illicit liquor containing methanol (which is often a component of \u2018bootlegged alcohol\u2019), particularly by the lower socio-economic classes.\nSolution to Question 13:\nFomepizole is the drug of choice for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning:\nFomepizole (preferred) or ethanol (if fomepizole is unavailable) - inhibits the enzyme alcoho dehydrogenase\nSodium bicarbonate - correct systemic acidosis\nHemodialysis - for elevated toxic alcohol levels, severe acid-base derangements, or evidence of end-organ toxicity\nCo-factors (folic acid, thiamine, and pyridoxine) - optimizes non-toxic metabolic pathways for the elimination of parent alcohol or its metabolites\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given scenario point towards ethylene glycol poisoning.\nEthylene glycol is converted to glyoxyaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glyoxyaldehyde causes kidney damage.\nMethanol is converted to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde causes retinal damage like blurring of vision/loss of vision.\nThe principles of treatment for both these conditions are the same. It predominantly involves using fomipezole or ethanol to inhibit the metabolic conversion of these relatively non-toxic alcohols to their toxic metabolites.\nSolution to Question 15:\nEthanol has a higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than methanol. Hence, the metabolism of methanol is slowed down on ethanol administration.\nFormic acid, the metabolite of methanol is highly toxic. Therefore, slowing down the metabolism reduces the toxic effects.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of methanol poisoning. Hemodialysis is effective and used in severe cases.\nA serum methanol concentration greater than 50 mg/dl is an indicator for hemodialysis. It can be used to remove both methanol and its toxic metabolite formic acid from the blood.\nFomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor is indicated in methanol toxicity. It acts by inhibiting the formation of toxic formic acid.\nIntravenous ethanol is an alternative to fomepizole. It has a higher affinity to alcohol dehydrogenase than methanol. Therefore, a saturation of ADH enzymes results in less formation of toxic formic acid.\nFolate-dependent systems are responsible for the oxidation of formic acid to CO2. Both folinic and folic acid are often administered during methanol toxicity but the exact benefit is yet to be determined.\nInorganic Irritants - Metallic and Non-metallic\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following poison can be found even in skeletonized remains of the body?\nArsenic\nMercury\nThallium\nLead\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is the most toxic form of arsenic?\nAceto arsenate\nArsine\nArsenite\nArsenic oxide\nQuestion 3:\nA person presents to the emergency department with suspected poisoning due to ingestion of arsenic-containing pesticides 6 hours ago.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nArsenic can be found even in skeletonized remains of the body. It delays putrefaction and can be found in bones, hair, and nails for several years.\nIt becomes fixed in the cancellous tissues of the long bones by\nthe conversion of phosphates to arsenates. The elimination of arsenic in this form is much slower and can be detected in the bones for several years after death.\nHeavy metals such as lead, copper, mercury, including metalloids like arsenic and antimony, may be found in bones for a prolonged period in cases of chronic poisoning. They are also deposited in hair, nails, etc. For these reasons, when heavy metal poisoning is suspected, these specimens are collected in addition to the routine viscera and body fluids.\nSolution to Question 2:\nArsine gas is the most toxic form of arsenic (acute exposure).\nThe toxicity of arsenic compounds can vary greatly. In general, arsenic compounds can be ranked from highest to lowest toxicity:\nInorganic trivalent (+3) compounds\nOrganic trivalent (+3) compounds\nInorganic pentavalent (+5) compounds\nOrganic pentavalent (+5) compounds\nElemental arsenic\nInorganic arsenic is generally more toxic than organic arsenic. Forms of arsenic that are more rapidly absorbed are more toxic, while those most rapidly eliminated tend to be less toxic.\nArsenite and arsenate forms are highly soluble in water.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given scenario is indicative of acute arsenic poisoning. Mees lines are unlikely to be found in a patient with arsenic ingestion 6 hours ago. It is seen in chronic poisoning.\nFeatures of acute arsenic poisoning:\nSevere watery diarrhea (like cholera)\nQTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias\nAcute encephalopathy\nRenal injury with acute tubular necrosis\nGarlic odor of breath and stools\nMees lines are horizontal 1 to 2 mm white lines on the nails, also called transverse leukonychia. They occur due to a disturbance in the nail matrix keratinization. It may be seen 4 to 6 weeks after acute arsenic ingestion. These can also be seen in thallium poisoning.\nThe image given below shows Mees lines.\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nAcrodynia (pink disease) is a feature of mercury poisoning, not arsenic poisoning. Features of chronic arsenic exposure:\nSkin lesions-\nHyperpigmentation (raindrop pigmentation resembling measles) or hypopigmentation\nHyperkeratosis of palms and soles.\nNail changes (Mees lines)\nSkin carcinomas and Bowen disease\nPeripheral vascular disease leading to Blackfoot disease (gangrene)\nNeurologic manifestations -\nPolyneuropathy\nPainful paraesthesia of hands and feet\nCardiovascular - coronary heart disease and stroke\nEndocrine - Diabetes Mellitus type 2\nNote: Some people take arsenic daily as a tonic or as an aphrodisiac and they acquire tolerance to 250\u2013300 mg or more in one dose. Such people are known as arsenophagists.\nThe image below shows hyperkeratosis of palms.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nChronic low-dose arsenic exposure can mimic diabetes mellitus type 2 and not diabetes insipidus. C inical features of chronic arsenic poisoning can resemble the following:\nAddison's disease - due to hyperpigmentation on chronic exposure\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome - sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy one to three weeks after the exposure\nKorsakoff\u2019s syndrome - chronic encephalopathy with delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, and confabulation can occur in chronic exposure\nCholera like gastroenteritis - occurs in acute poisoning\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of acute arsenic poisoning. For a definitive diagnosis, the arsenic levels are measured in 24-hour urine samples.\nIf the baseline urinary level is within normal limits and arsenic intoxication is still suspected, hair and nail clippings should be harvested for laboratory analysis. Due to the rapid distribution of arsenic in tissues, blood arsenic levels are unreliable.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given images (raindrop pigmentation and Mees lines) along with the clinical features are suggestive of chronic arsenic poisoning. Chelation therapy for subacute or chronic severe arsenic\ntoxicity is succimer (DMSA). It is an oral hydrophilic analog of BAL. For acute arsenic toxicity, the following can be used:\nBAL (British anti-Lewisite)\nDMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid)\nDMPS (Dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate)\nBAL tends to remain the initial chelating drug for severe, acute arsenic toxicity. For other cases, DMSA or DMPS may be used.\nThe images given below shows characteristic raindrop pigmentation and Mees lines, seen in chronic arsenic poisoning.\n\nNote: Arsenic is used industrially as an alloying agent and in the processing of glass, pigments, textiles, paper, metal adhesives, wood preservatives and ammunition. Arsenic is also used in the hide tanning process and, to a limited extent, in pesticides, feed additives, and pharmaceuticals.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given image (acrodynia) and the clinical features point towards a diagnosis of chronic organic mercury poisoning (methyl mercury). Mercury acts as a poison by binding to sulfhydryl groups on enzymes.\nMechanisms of toxicity of mercury:\nHigh-affinity binding of divalent mercury to sulfhydryl groups of proteins in the cells is an important mechanism for producing nonspecific cell injury or even cell death.\nBoth inorganic and methylmercury damage mitochondria and disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis\nMethylmercury also affects the MAPK signaling pathway\nMethylmercury has also been shown to disrupt microtubules in neurites\nOrofacial paresthesias is the initial common symptom of chronic mercury poisoning followed by headache, tremor, and fatigue. Other features include mild GI, renal, and pulmonary abnormalities.\nIn severe cases, the following features are seen:\nAtaxia\nMuscle rigidity and spasticity\nBlindness\nHearing deficits\nDementia (neurotoxicity)\nSolution to Question 9:\nHydrargyrism means mercury poisoning. Bowen's disease is associated with chronic low-level exposure to arsenic, not mercury.\nFeatures of chronic mercury poisoning:\nTremors - most consistent manifestation. They are:\nDanbury tremors - fine muscle fasciculations punctuated every few minutes by coarse shaking or jerky movements, intentional type. Progression of tremors is hands \uf0b0 lips\uf0b0 tongue\uf0b0 arms and egs.\nHatter's shakes - Severe impairment of daily activities involving delicate movements like shaving, writing, holding a tumbler or spoon.\nConcussio mercurialis - most severe form, literally no activity is possible.\nErethism mercurialis - Shyness, memory loss, and change in personality\nNephrotic syndrome and renal tubular anomalies\nAcrodynia (pink disease) - Seen in small children and characterized by a generalized rash; edema and erythema of the palms, soles, and face.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe mercury found in a glass thermometer is elemental mercury. The absorption of elemental mercury by the GI tract is usually negligible, unless the mucosa is damaged. Hence, no treatment is required.\nFor ingestion of inorganic and organic mercury salts, the following steps are followed:\nAggressive IV hydration\nGI decontamination, including gastric lavage\nActivated charcoa\nDimercaprol and succimer are the preferred chelators for mercury poisoning.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy related to chronic mercury poisoning (Minamata disease). There is no effective treatment for patients with toxic chronic exposure to organic mercury, and hence only supportive care is provided\nThis is most commonly associated with the consumption of mercury-rich fish (such as shark, swordfish, bonito, mackerel, marlin, and bluefin tuna).\nSymptoms are generally resistant to treatment with chelators. Dimercaprol (BAL) should not be used, because it increases the mobilization of mercury to the brain. Treatment with oral DMSA is unlikely to reverse the neurologic damage. Hence, there is no effective treatment for Minamata disease.\nFor patients with toxic exposure to elemental mercury or inorganic mercury, the following are effective:\nDMSA (succimer)\nDMPS\nBAL (dimercaprol)\nFor severe acute organic mercury poisoning, succimer is used.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image is showing characteristic Burtonian lines, which are seen in lead poisoning and mercury poisoning.\nThese are bluish-grey gingival lead lines that occur with chronic exposure to lead poisoning.\nThe image given below shows Burtonian lines on the gums.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThis given clinical scenario is suggestive of lead intoxication. The enzyme defective in this condition is ALA dehydratase.\nThe most common cause of lead poisoning in children is seen due to lead paint which was used in the older times.\nIt is toxic because it can substitute for calcium in many fundamental cellular processes. It crosses red blood cell membranes as well as the blood-brain barrier and enters the neuroglia cells which support brain function.\nThe fatal dose of lead acetate is 20 g. The fatal period is 1-2 days.\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given image shows basophilic stippling, which occurs due to inhibition of pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase.\nBasophilic stippling in red blood cells occurs due to impaired clearing of cellular RNA degradation products (due to inhibition of pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase).\nThis finding is seen in the following:\nLead toxicity\nArsenic toxicity\nSideroblastic anemia\nThalassemias\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe blood lead levels are the best single test for evaluating lead toxicity.\nLevels at or &gt;5 micrograms/dL (0.24 micromol/L) are considered elevated in children.\nThe edetate calcium disodium provocation test and testing for erythrocyte protoporphyrin (e.g., free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, zinc protoporphyrin) and urinary lead levels are no longer recommended.\nSolution to Question 16:\nSaturnine gout is seen in chronic lead intoxication or poisoning.\nThe features of saturnine gout are the same as primary gout but it affects the knee more than the first metatarsophalangeal joint and tophi rarely develop. Lead exposure should be suspected if a patient presents with the triad of:\nSaturnine gout\nHypertension\nRenal insufficiency (renal failure and interstitial fibrosis)\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe X-ray is suggestive of lead lines seen in lead toxicity which are due to the deposition of calcium at the growth plates.\nThe radiodensity of the lead line is due to persistent mineralized metaphyseal cartilage and not to a primary osseous change or lead itself. It is the result of a lead-induced inability of\ncartilage-resorbing cells to degrade the mineralized matrix. This impairs the resorption of metaphyseal cartilage.\nSolution to Question 18:\nDimercaprol (BAL) must be administered in lead toxicity-induced encephalopathy. Lead encephalopathy is suspected when a patient presents with:\nAcute onset of persistent vomiting\nAlteration of mental status and/or seizures\nEmergency initiation of chelation therapy must be done if it is suspected clinically.\nEncephalopathy due to lead poisoning typically occurs in toddlers age 15 to 30 months old, with blood lead levels &gt;100 microgram/dl. Children with lead encephalopathy should receive combined chelation therapy with dimercaprol and calcium disodium edetate (CaNa2EDTA).\nNote: Administration BAL worsens symptoms in methyl mercury poisoning, not in lead poisoning.\nSolution to Question 19:\nMetal fume fever is most commonly associated with zinc oxide.\nIt is an influenza-like syndrome with fever, myalgias, profuse sweating, and other symptoms that usually occur 3\u201310 hours after heavy exposure to a variety of metal oxides. It is also known\nas Smelter's shakes or metal shakes.\nIt can also be associated with copper and magnesium.\nSolution to Question 20:\nItai-Itai disease (Japan), also called ouch-ouch disease is due to bone pain caused by cadmium.\nCadmium causes nephrotoxicity leading to hypercalciuria. This subsequently causes osteomalacia leading to bone pain.\nSolution to Question 21:\nLuminescent stools are seen in acute phosphorus poisoning. The vomitus and stools will be luminous in the dark.\nThe stools may give rise to faint fumes, constituting the smoky stool syndrome.\nSolution to Question 22:\nExcess of selenium causes alkali disease in livestock. C inical types of selenium intoxication:\nAcute selenosis\nSubacute selenosis (i.e., blind staggers type)\nChronic selenosis (i.e., alkali disease type)\nAlkali disease occurs when animals consume moderate levels of selenium for a period of weeks to months.\nThe usual clinical signs of chronic selenosis in horses, cattle, and swine are loss of hair (horses and cattle lose long hair from the mane and tails), emaciation, hoof lesions, weight reduction, and lameness.\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe correct order of symptomatology in iron toxicity is 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt;1.\nSymptoms of iron toxicity are divided into 4 stages:\nStage 1 (few hours after ingestion): vomiting, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, acidosis, and coma\nStage 2 (6-24 hours): Asymptomatic phase\nStage 3 (24-48 hours): Metabolic acidosis, jaundice, hypoglycemia, shock, coma with hepatic and renal failure.\nStage 4 (1-2 weeks): Late complications such as gastric stricture and pyloric stenosis. Iron exerts its toxic effects by increasing capillary permeability, release of hydrogen ions,\ninhibition of mitochondrial function, and direct corrosive action on the gastric mucosa. Ingestion of 20 to 30 grams is considered to be fatal and the fatal period is around 24-30 hours.\nDesferrioxamine is the mainstay of treatment with supportive gastric lavage, administration of egg and milk to form iron-protein complexes, oral MgOH solution, and hemodialysis in severe cases.\nPostmortem changes in iron toxicity include:\nHemorrhagic necrosis of gastric mucosa with perforation of gastric or jejunal wa\nAcute hepatic necrosis\nDegenerative renal tubular changes\nOrganic Irritants - Plant and Animal Poisons\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following plants is commonly referred to as poison hemlock?\nRicinus communis\nAbrus precatorius\nConium maculatum\nNerium odorum\nQuestion 2:\nA 5-year-old child dies after consuming poisoned hemlock by accident. What is the likely mechanism by which the death occurred in this patient?\nInhibition of cytochrome oxidase\nAnticholinesterase activity\nInhibition of glycine reuptake\nOverstimulation of nicotinic receptors\nQuestion 3:\nWhich among the following is not a cardiac poison?\nNicotiana tabacum\nNerium odorum\nCerbera thevetia\nCicuta maculate\nQuestion 4:\nA patient is brought due to accidental exposure to the following plant roots while experimenting with herbs.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nConium maculatum is commonly referred to as poison hemlock.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nDeath from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) occurs due to the overstimulation of nicotinic receptors.\nAll parts of poison hemlock contain coniine and similar alkaloids that are structurally and functionally analogous to nicotine. The mechanism of poisoning is two-fold:\nNon depolarising muscle blockade at the neuromuscular junction leading to flaccid paralysis and respiratory paralysis.\nInitial overstimulation followed by rapid depression by the nicotinic receptors.\nThese cause symptoms such as salivation, mydriasis, initial tachycardia followed by bradycardia, coma and death. Typically, ingestion of poison hemlock is due to misidentification because of its similarity in appearance to wild carrots.\nSolution to Question 3:\nCicuta maculate (water hemlock) is a convulsant, not a cardiac poison. The following are considered cardiac poisons:\nDigitalis purpurea - contains digitoxin, digitalin, digitonin, and digoxin\nNerium odorum (Oleander) - contains oleandroside (oleandrin) and nerioside (nerin) which resemble digitalis in action\nCerbera thevetia (yellow oleander) - contains thevetin and thevetoxin, similar to digitalis in action.\nCerbera odollam - closely related to cerebra thevetia\nAconite - Aconitine is the major component\nQuinine\nNicotine\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe image shows roots resembling horseradish, suggestive of the aconite plant. Hippus is associated with aconite poisoning.\nHippus is an abnormal exaggeration of the rhythmic contraction and dilatation of the pupil, independent of changes in illumination or in fixation of the eyes.\nPoisoning with aconite has never been common. Most reported cases are accidental in nature, resulting from therapeutic misadventures. Aconite is used in herbal medicines, or to increase the intoxicating effect of alcoholic beverages.\nOption B: Hunan hand is due to capsicum annum. Dermatitis and burning of hands and fingers known as Hunan hand. This is common among the pickle industry workers, who use their hands for handling chilly paste or powder for a prolonged period.\nOption C: Jamaican vomiting sickness, is a syndrome characterized by vomiting and hypoglycemia, seen in ingestion of the unripe ackee fruit.\nOption D: St Anthony's fire is the burning pain seen in gangrene caused by ergot poisoning.\nThe image below is of horseradish, given for comparison.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe image shown is of the Ricinus communis (castor oil) plant. Ricin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis.\nThe main toxic element of the castor oil plant is ricin, a toxalbumin. It exerts its toxicity by entering cells and inhibiting protein synthesis. The entire plant is toxic, but the seeds contain the highest amount of toxalbumin.\nSolution to Question 6:\nAbrus precatorius is commonly used as a cattle poison in the form of suis. Toxic principles of Abrus precatorius are:\nAbrin\nAbrine\nAbralin\nMedicolegal importance - It is a commonly used cattle poison in Indian villages by injecting the seed extract into the animal in the form of certain fine needle-shaped structures known as sui (meaning needle in Hindi).\nThese are prepared by mixing the seed extract with opium, datura, and spirit/water and then blended into a paste, shaped into fine needles dried in the sun, and used to kill cattle by driving it deep into the animal body by blowing through a hollow bamboo pipe.\nThe image given below shows seeds of Abrus precatorius.\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nSemecarpus anacardium can be used to produce fake bruises.\nWhen the juice of the seed is applied to the skin, it causes irritation, itching, and a painful blister. The lesion resembles a bruise.\nThe image shows Semecarpus anacardium seeds which are black, cone, or heart-shaped with a rough projection at the base.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe image shows seeds of Strychnos-nux vomica which contains strychnine. It is a competitive antagonist of glycine at the postsynaptic receptors in the motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. This leads to increased activity in the motor neurons.\nThe fatal dose is 15-30 mg of strychnine or one crushed seed. If death is preceded by a severe convulsion, as in strychnine poisoning, it causes an increase in the body temperature\ncalled postmortem caloricity.\nThe toxin strychnine does not affect any receptors in the brain and the person remains conscious till death. Strychnine poisoning is characterized by conscious seizures.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe characteristic finding of aconite toxicity is numbness and tingling.\nAconite is also known as monk's hood or wolf's bane. The roots are the most poisonous part of the plant and are mistaken for horseradish root.\nThe toxic principle is aconitine. It acts on the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of the cell membranes of excitable tissues. Aconitine first stimulates and then paralyzes the peripheral terminations of sensory and secretory nerves, CNS, and nerves of the myocardium, skeletal and smooth muscles.\nPatients present mainly with a combination of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological features. Numbness and tingling are characteristic features. The fatal period is 2-6 hours.\nAconite is commonly used for homicidal poisoning because:\nCheap and easily available\nShort fatal period\nExtremely unstable and destroyed by putrefaction\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe plant in the image is Digitalis purpurea. Its active principle is digitonin.\nDigitalis purpurea contains digitoxin, digitalin, digitonin, and digoxin. It can cause cardiac dysrhythmia in acute toxicity.\nSolution to Question 11:\nDigitalis purpurea is also known as foxglove. The most specific antidote for its poisoning is digoxin-immune Fab fragments.\nDigitalis is a cardioactive steroid that acts by inhibiting the sodium/potassium (Na+-K+) ATPase pump. Acute toxicity closely resembles that caused by digoxin and includes early GI\nsymptoms, followed by cardiac dysrhythmias.\nDigoxin immune Fab fragments should be administered to those with serum potassium &gt;5 mEq/L in patients with acute toxicity.\nThe following image shows the Digitalis purpurea plant.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image is of aconite. All parts of this plant (especially the roots and seeds) are poisonous. Varieties of this plant are monkhood, mitha zaher, bish, and bikh.\nIt is a cardiac poison and causes AV block, bradycardia. Atropine is used in the treatment of its toxicity.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given plant is Erythroxylum cocca.\nCocaine is the principal alkaloid found in the cultivated varieties of coca.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given clinical scenario with dilatation of the pupil indicates Atropa belladonna consumption.\nAtropa Belladonna acts by inhibiting the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine. All the parts of the plants are toxic. The active principle is 1-hyoscyamine.\nHeroin, morphine, and malathion cause constriction of the pupil.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario with hypoglycemia as the predominant feature is most likely Jamaican vomiting sickness.\nAckee fruit grows on the Blighia sapida tree, and it is a common ingredient in West African and Jamaican cuisine. Unripe ackee fruit contains heat-stable toxins hypoglycin A and B. The resulting clinical syndrome, which is characterized by severe vomiting and hypoglycemia, is Jamaican vomiting sickness.\nOption A: Hippus is an abnormal exaggeration of the rhythmic contraction and dilatation of the pupil seen in aconite poisoning.\nOption C: Ophitoxemia is snake envenomation.\nOption D: St. Anthony's fire is the burning pain seen in gangrene caused by ergot poisoning.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe drug of choice for mushroom poisoning is atropine.\nStropharia semeglobata, Hypholoma fasciculare, and Lactarius vellereus are among the poisonous varieties of mushrooms found in India. It presents with signs of parasympathetic excess and hence atropine is the drug of choice.\nAtropine is of no value in the delayed onset of mushroom poisoning that occurs after ingestion of Amanita phyllodes.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of nicotine poisoning.\nChronic poisoning of nicotine also known as nicotine addiction leads to a condition called tobacco heart. It is characterized by irregularities of the heart with occasional extrasystoles and angina. It also causes amblyopia and narrowing of the field of vision.\nEffects on CVS and eyes by different poisons are given below:\nPoiso n\nEffect on CVS\nEffect on ocular system\nCocai ne\nTachycardiaSystemic arterial hypertensionMI (due to coro nary vasoconstriction)Tachya rrhythmiasDilated cardiomyo pathyAortic dissection & rupt ure\nMadarosis (Loss of eyebrow/e yelashes)Corneal abrasions/ul cerationsCRAOBilateral blind ness\nPoiso\tEffect on CVS\tEffect on ocular system n\nPoiso\tEffect on CVS\tEffect on ocular system n\nPoiso\tEffect on CVS\tEffect on ocular system n\nNicoti ne\nIrregularities of heart with oc casional extrasystoleEpisodes of chest pain suggestive of a ngina\nAmblyopiaNarrowing of field of visionBlindness\nCann abis\nTachycardiaPalpitationHyper tension\nBloodshot eyes (conjunctival congestions),Occasional myd riasisNystagmus\nAtrop ine\nTachycardiaArrhythmias\nDilated pupil (Mydriasis)Dipl opia\nSolution to Question 18:\nCommon krait belongs to the Elapidae family.\nNote: Crotalinae is a subfamily of Viperidae. Pit Viper belongs to the family Viperidae and the subfamily Crotalinae, so if the question is about Viper any of the two options can be selected as the correct answer based on the choices given in the question.\nFamily\nSpecies\nColubri dae\nBoomslangKeel snakeTwig sn ake\nElapida e\nCobraKraitSea snakes\nViperida e\nPit viperRussell's viper\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe venom of sea snakes is myotoxic. Myotoxin causes a non-enzymatic mechanism that leads to severe muscle necrosis.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe correct match is:\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nIncomplete belly scales are usually seen in non-poisonous snakes.\nIn poisonous snakes, belly scales are large and cover the entire belly.\nSolution to Question 22:\nSnakes of the Elapidae family are found to be able to control the injection of venom when they are biting.\nBecause of this, they can decide when to inject venom and when not to, this leads to the frequent occurrence of a dry bite in the case of Elapidae (they choose not to inject venom).\nCrotalinae snakes (pit viper) which are part of the Viperidae family, also have voluntary control over the injection of venom and 25% of their bites are dry.\nSolution to Question 23:\nConstriction bands may be useful, especially when immediate medical care is not available.\nA constriction band is an elastic bandage or Penrose drain, thick rope, or piece of clothing wrapped circumferentially above the bite. It is applied with enough tension to restrict superficial venous and lymphatic flow while maintaining distal pulses and capillary filling.\nMeasures that can be done in the case of snakebite:\nApply firm pressure over the bitten area, which delays absorption of venom\nPressure immobilization is recommended for elapid and sea-snake bites, but not for viper bites as it may cause local necrosis\nClean the wound with soap and water, or iodine and cover with a sterile dressing\nImmediately apply a broad firm bandage (Sutherland wrap) on the bitten area and around the imb. As much of the limb should be bandaged as is possible. It should be tight enough to occlude the superficial venous and lymphatic return, but not the arterial or deep venous flow. A pressure of 50 to 70 mm Hg is maintained\nIn bites on the trunk, head, or neck, apply firm pressure over the bitten area\nImmobilize the limb, as movement can accelerate the spread of venom\nMake the patient lie on one side in the recovery position so that the airway is clear, in case of vomiting or fainting\nMeasures contraindicated in the case of snakebite:\nSuction and incision of the wound\nElectric shock treatment of wound site\nApplication of tourniquets because they obstruct arterial flow and cause ischemia\nIce water immersion of the bitten limb\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe given scenario with the persistent erection of the penis for &gt; 4 hours is indicative of priapism. It can occur with the bite or ingestion of the Spanish fly.\nSpanish fly is green in color with shiny wings of the same color. Cantharidin is an animal poison produced by cantharides (Spanish fly or blister beetle). It causes vesicle or blister formation and priapism.\nThe insect as such or the powder of dried body has the toxic (active) principle cantharidin. The route of absorption is skin and other mucosal surfaces.\nThe image given below shows cantharides/ Spanish fly/ blister beetle.\n\nSolution to Question 25:\nPrazosin acts as a physiological antidote for scorpion venom.\nThe venom is a clear, colorless, proteinous toxalbumen, having a hemolytic and neurotoxic effect. Its toxicity is more than that of snakes, but only a small quantity is injected. The venom is a potent autonomic stimulator, resulting in the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenals.\nIf the scorpion has hemolytic venom, the reaction is mainly local and simulates the viper snake bite. The scorpion sting will have only one hole in the center of the reddened area. The extremity will have edema, pain, and reddening. This usually lasts for one to two hours.\nThe symptoms produced by a neurotoxic venom are similar to a cobra bite. There is usually no marked reaction in the local area. Nausea, vomiting, extreme restlessness, fever, various types of paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression, and death may occur within hours from pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.\nPrazosin can counteract the alpha-adrenergic effects of autonomic stimulation, such as hypertension.\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe above image shows a human bite mark. The photograph is taken with two scales at the right angle to one another in the horizontal plane.\nHuman bites are usually semi-circular or crescentic caused by the front teeth (incisors, canine).\nSwabs of bite marks should be taken immediately using a swab moistened with sterile water. A sample of the control area adjacent to the mark and of the victim's saliva should also be taken using swabs moistened with sterile water.",

This means of administration produces heroin concentrations similar to those observed following IV administration.\nOther methods used to take drugs are:\nMainlining - Intravenous injection\nInsufflation - Snorting\nSkin popping - Subcutaneous injection\nSolution to Question 4:\nMiosis is not universally present in intoxication from every opioid. Its absence cannot be used to rule out opioid intoxication. Normal or even enlarged pupils have been documented secondary to diphenoxylate, meperidine, morphine, pentazocine, and propoxyphene toxicity.\nOpioid intoxication:\nMental status depression\nAnalgesia\nMiosis\nOrthostatic hypotension\nNausea and vomiting\nHistamine release resulting in localized urticaria\nIleus secondary to decreased GI motility\nUrinary retention secondary to increased vesical sphincter tone\nRespiratory depression, bronchospasm (histamine release), acute lung injury (rare complication)\nOpioid recept or\nEffects\nmu\nAnalgesiaSedationMiosisRes piratory depressionCough su ppressionEuphoriaDecreased GI motility\nkappa\nAnalgesiaSedationMiosisDecr eased GI motilityDysphoriaH allucinations\ndelta\nAnalgesiaAntidepressant effe ct\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe clinical features suggest opioid intoxication. Airway protection and ventilatory maintenance are the most important treatment steps. It is because respiratory depression is the major morbidity and the cause of all mortality.\nAfter adequate ventilation is ensured, administer naloxone. Single-dose activated charcoal can be administered in case of opioid ingestion occurred within one hour.\nF umazenil is the antidote for benzodiazepine poisoning.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of opioid withdrawal.\nThe features of opioid withdrawal are:\nFeeling of anxiety\nYawning\nLacrimation, diaphoresis, rhinorrhea\nDiffuse myalgias progressing to piloerection\nMydriasis\nNausea, profuse vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping Treatment of opioid withdrawal:\nSymptoms can be rendered more tolerable by the administration of the central \uf0612-agonist like clonidine\nAntiemetics and antidiarrheal agents\nDaily administration of a verified dose of methadone PO is recommended to inhibit withdrawa symptoms and reduce craving\nSolution to Question 7:\nCocaine is metabolized by butyrylcholinesterase/ pseudocholinesterase.\nCocaine is primarily metabolized in the liver, but, it is alternatively metabolized by pseudocholinesterase also.\nMorphine, methamphetamine, and barbiturates are metabolized only in the liver.\nSolution to Question 8:\nCT imaging is the best modality to identify cocaine packets in a body packer.\nBody packers are people who swallow a large number of well-sealed packets in order to smuggle drugs across international borders.\nBody stuffers are patients who swallow cocaine following police pursuit to conceal the evidence. The swallowed packets are often poorly wrapped and can leak or perforate.\nBoth methods can result in severe toxicity and death. Management:\nNo signs of toxicity - Give single-dose activated charcoal and institute whole-bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution to gently hasten packet elimination\nSymptomatic patients - Provide sedation and symptomatic care, and obtain immediate surgica consultation for operative removal of the packets\nEndoscopy or colonoscopy is not done because the manipulation may rupture the packets.\nSolution to Question 9:\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is most commonly sold as small squares of dried blotter paper printed with colorful graphics.\nIt is a colorless, tasteless, odorless, water-soluble substance. A heavy user of LSD is called an acid head.\nSolution to Question 10:\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use may be associated with bad trips and flashbacks.\nThe psychedelic effects of LSD depend on the user\u2019s prevailing mood, expectations, and surrounding environment. Effects may be perceived as pleasurable or horrifying. Profound distortions in the perception of sensory stimuli, time, emotions, and memories occur. It may cause users to experience paranoia, depression, extreme panic, or an acute psychotic reaction known as a dysphoric reaction or bad trip.\nProlonged and sometimes permanent psychosis, known as flashbacks or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, can occur.\nSolution to Question 11:\nMethamphetamine is also known as ice. Habitual meth users might get meth mouth (advanced tooth decay).\nOption A: Amotivational syndrome - Chronic use of cannabis may lead to amotivational syndrome with lethargy, lack of interest in day-to-day activities.\nOption B: Run amok - Run-amok is a psychic disturbance resulting from continued use or sudden consumption of cannabis. It is characterized by a peculiar homicidal mania. The person is not held responsible for his acts since run amok is considered a disorder of mind and not intoxication.\nOption D: Magnan syndrome - A type of tactile hallucination seen in chronic users of cocaine where they feel as if grains of sand are lying under the skin or insects are creeping on the skin (formication).\nOther named effects of drug use:\nCrack dancing - Choreo athetosis and repetitive movements are associated with cocaine and amphetamine intoxication and appear related to dopamine dysregulation.\nCrack eye - A syndrome of corneal abrasions and ulcerations secondary to smoke and irritation associated with crack cocaine use is known as the crack eye.\nCrack baby - describes children who were exposed to crack as fetuses in the US.\nBad trip - Profound distortions in the perception of sensory stimuli, time, emotions, and memories occur with the use of LSD. It may cause users to experience paranoia, depression, extreme panic, or an acute psychotic reaction known as a dysphoric reaction or bad trip.\nFlashbacks - Prolonged and sometimes permanent psychosis, known as flashbacks or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, can result from LSD use.\nCarphologia - Carphologia (or carphology) is a lint-picking behavior that is often a symptom of a delirious state. Usually associated with Datura poisoning.\nSolution to Question 12:\nAfter a single use of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (active principle of Cannabis) can be detected in urine tests for up to 3 days.\nMarijuana or Cannabis consists of the dried flowering tops and leaves of the plant Cannabis sativa. Hashish is prepared from the resin of the stems and leaves of this plant.\nWith long-term use, cannabinoids can be detected up to 30 days or longer after abstinence.\nSolution to Question 13:\nPhencyclidine causes dissociative anesthesia.\nPhencyclidine is also known as angel dust (powdered form). It is often coadministered with crack cocaine (beam me up). The primary action is the blockade of NMDA receptors.\nDissociative anesthesia is a form of anesthesia characterized by catalepsy, catatonia, analgesia, and amnesia. It does not necessarily involve loss of consciousness and thus does not always imply a state of general anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 14:\nHeroin is the most common drug which can cause physical dependence.\nPhysical dependence is defined is a condition where withdrawal of a drug after its prolonged use causes physiological and emotional illness, often referred to as the withdrawal syndrome. Neither physical dependence nor withdrawal symptoms occur with hallucinogens. Although it is necessary to note that a user can develop a psychological dependence on the insight-inducing experiences of episodes of hallucinogen use. Hence, all 3 hallucinogens - ketamine, LSD, and Phencyclidine (PCP) does not cause physical dependence.\nAccording to the world drug report 2019, released by the United Nations office on drugs and crime (UNODC), the most common drugs used across the world (in decreasing order) include:\nCannabis\nOpioids\nAmphetamine and prescription stimulants\nEcstacy\nCocaine\nAmong the opioids, the commonly used group of drugs are opiates which include drugs like opium, morphine, and heroin.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe plant shown in the image is Papaver somniferum. The toxic part of the plant is the unripe fruit capsule from which the toxic principle is derived.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe plant in the given image is Datura stramonium. It contains atropine.\nAll Datura species contain anticholinergic alkaloids like atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of Datura poisoning.\nThe two species are jimson weed (Datura stramonium) and angel\u2019s trumpet (Datura candida).\nSeeds or other parts of the plant can be ingested or smoked. Poisoning leads to delirium, hallucinations, and seizures. Additionally, other classic anticholinergic effects, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, dry mouth and skin, blurred vision, urinary retention, and hyperthermia may present.\nGastric emptying is often delayed, and the small, plentiful seeds can become trapped among the gastrointestinal folds after ingestion. Thus gastric decontamination can be an important therapy.\nPhysostigmine, a reversible acetylcholine esterase antagonist, is an effective treatment for severe anticholinergic poisoning.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe given clinical scenario suggests barbiturate poisoning. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist and has no effect on barbiturate toxicity. There is no antidote for barbiturate poisoning.\nManagement of barbiturate poisoning:\nMaintain airway, breathing, circulation\nElectrolyte balance\nGastric lavage\nAlkaline diuresis by giving sodium bicarbonate\nHemodialysis in severe cases",
