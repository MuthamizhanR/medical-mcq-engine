In the early stages of wound healing, type III collagen is synthesized. It is replaced by type I collagen as wound healing progresses.\nThe tensile strength of the healing wound is directly proportional to the amount and type of collagen present. During healing, as disorganized collagen is degraded and reformed, covalent cross-links are formed that enhance tensile strength. The maximum strength of the healed wound depends upon the interconnection of collagen subunits. Approximately 80 percent of the original strength of the tissue is obtained by six weeks after surgery. Wounds slowly continue to get stronger but may never achieve 100 percent of their previous strength.\n\n\n",

Lysosomes lack most normal enzymes and thus accumulate undegraded molecules, forming inclusion bodies.\nIt is characterized by the following:\nCoarse facial features\nGingival hyperplasia\nClouded corneas\nRestricted joint movements\nClaw hand deformities\nKyphoscoliosis\nHigh plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes\n\n\n\n\n",

It has a central core with proteolytic enzymes. Proteins that are tagged by ubiquitin to be degraded enter the core through regulatory rings on either side of the cylinder.\n\n\n\nClinical relevance: It plays an important role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes as it degrades viruses and other molecules to small peptides.\n\n\n\nThe tertiary structure is three dimensional is the right answer among the given options.

They bind to the short sequences of hydrophobic amino acids of an extended polypeptide. Thus, they shield the new polypeptide being synthesized from aggregating. This provides the polypeptide an opportunity to form an appropriate secondary structure.\nWhen a protein is thermodynamically trapped in a misfolded dead-end form, chaperones can rescue the protein by unfolding their hydrophobic ends.

It is the most frequent urea cycle defect. Biochemical findings include elevated levels of glutamine in the blood, urine, CSF, low citrulline, and high urinary orotic acid. This condition may be precipitated by a switch from formula to whole milk.\nUrea cycle disorders are all characterized by hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis. There is an accumulation of the precursors of urea - ammonia, and glutamine. They include:\nDefect in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I - Hyperammonemia type 1\nDefect in ornithine transcarbamoylase - Hyperammonemia type 2\nDefect in argininosuccinate synthetase - Citrullinemia\nDefect in argininosuccinate lyase- Argininosuccinic aciduria\nDefect in the gene for arginase- Hyperargininemia\nClinical features of urea cycle disorders are common to all and include vomiting, avoidance of high-protein foods, intermittent ataxia, irritability, lethargy, and severe mental retardation.\nNote: Classically, Type 2 Hyperammonemia is an X- linked recessive disorder.

This condition occurs due to the deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase.\nThere is an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which then enters into pyrimidine\nsynthesis producing orotic acid and uracil and leading to orotic aciduria and high uracil in blood and urine. Since the ammonia from glutamine is not converted into urea, its level increases.\nGlutamate is not regenerated. Since glutamate is not available for transamination, amino acids\n\ncannot be used for gluconeogenesis. Hence, the glucose level drops in the blood. Treatment:\nReducing intake of ammonia - Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restricted and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat.\nIncreasing excretion of ammonia - Addition of phenylbutyrate, which scavenges nitrogen by combining with amino acids to form a more water-soluble product.

Further investigation reveals myoglobinuria and elevated creatine kinase enzyme level in blood.\nWhich transporter deficiency is responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease?\nCreatine\nCreatinine\nCarnitine\nAcyl carrier protein\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nA young boy with muscle aches, hypotonia, poor exercise tolerance, myoglobinuria and elevated creatine kinase suggests a deficiency of carnitine.\nCarnitine is a key transporter needed for beta-oxidation of fatty acids. It binds to acyl-CoAs to form acylcarnitine. This helps in the transfer of fatty acids across the impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. Thus, carnitine deficiency results in impaired beta-oxidation of fatty acids. There will be inadequate ATP production in response to increased\ndemands (e.g. exercise) with excess fatty acid accumulation in muscle cells. This results in muscle breakdown.\nPatients with carnitine deficiency present with hypoglycemia, muscle aches, hypotonia and poor exercise tolerance (myopathy). They have high levels of serum creatine kinase. Treatment includes carnitine supplementation.\n\n\n",

This leads to the accumulation of dicarboxylic acids leading to dicarboxylic aciduria. It is characterized by:\nExcretion of C6-C10 \uf077-dicarboxylic acids (medium-chain) in the urine.\nNonketotic hypoglycemia: due to the lack of ATP and acetyl CoA from \uf062-oxidation (which is an activator of pyruvate carboxylase) to support gluconeogenesis.\nDefects in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase have been identified as a cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\nOmega-oxidation is an alternative way of fatty acid oxidation in the body when the beta-oxidation enzymes are either saturated or defective. Omega oxidation converts excess fatty acids to dicarboxylic acids that are soluble and hence can be excreted out via urine.\nOther options:\nOption A: Impaired Alpha oxidation leads to Refsum\u2019s disease.

His breath has a fruity smell and urinalysis shows a positive ketostix test. The activity of which of the following enzymes is increased in him?\nHMG CoA synthase\nHMG CoA reductase\nAcetyl CoA carboxylase\nPyruvate dehydrogenase\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 16:\nA fruity smell (presence of acetone in breath) and positive ketostix test (ketonuria) on the background of prolonged starvation is suggestive of starvation ketosis. This is characterized by increased activity of HMG CoA synthase enzyme.\nProlonged starvation implies a catabolic state in which there is excessive \uf062-oxidation leading to increased production of acetyl CoA. The excessive acetyl CoA is utilised by the hepatocytes to synthesise ketone bodies for extrahepatic utilisation.\nHMG CoA synthase is the enzyme required for ketone body synthesis, it is also the rate-limiting enzyme.\n\nOther options:\nHMG CoA reductase is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol.\nAcetyl CoA carboxylase is involved in the fatty acid synthesis.\nPyruvate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA.\nAll three enzymes are inactive in low insulin state (such as prolonged starvation).\n\n\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 19:\n\nA 12-year-old girl suffers from an inadequately treated type 1 diabetes mellitus. She is currently hyperglycemic. Which of the following is most likely to occur?\nGlycogenesis in muscle\nIncreased protein synthesis\nIncreased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA\nDecreased cholesterol synthesis\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nWith the background of inadequately treated type I diabetes mellitus, an insulin-deficient state in the body is expected which will lead to increased conversion of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA.\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is commonly found in the adolescent population. In response to certain precipitating factors, such patients may develop a severe insulin-deficient state. Since insulin is an inhibitor of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an insulin-deficient state will cause HSL overactivity in adipocytes and the breakdown of lipid into fatty acids (lipolysis). Free fatty acids will undergo beta-oxidation and produce a large amount of acetyl CoA, which gets converted to ketone bodies ( acetoacetate, acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, etc.)\n\n\n\n2, 3 and 4 statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type1 DM.\nType 1 DM is characterized by a deficiency in insulin production. Since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 (insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal muscles. So adipose tissue mobilizes fat to be used as an energy source. These FFA (free fatty acids) are oxidized to acetoacetyl CoA which serves as a precursor for ketone body synthesis.\nAs the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately more of the acetyl-CoA produced from their breakdown is converted to ketone bodies and less is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to CO2. A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. Such a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased\n\uf062-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of\noxaloacetate is decreased.\nBeta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis. Increased rate of ketone body synthesis in insulin-deficient state implies an increased activity of beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase enzyme.\n\nBiosynthesis of fatty acids and Eicosanoids\n",

Propionyl CoA is carboxylated to methylmalonyl CoA by propionyl CoA carboxylase, a biotin-dependent enzyme that requires ATP hydrolysis.\nMethylmalonyl CoA is further converted into succinyl CoA by racemase and mutase, (a vitamin B12 dependent enzyme) which enters into the TCA cycle.Thus, propionyl CoA can be converted into glucose by gluconeogenesis.\n\n\nNote:\nMethylmalonyl CoA mutase is a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme.\nPropionyl residue from an odd-chain fatty acid is the only part of a fatty acid that is glucogenic.\n\n\n",

On the other hand, each cycle of\nbeta-oxidation also produces 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH generating 1.5 ATP and 2.5 ATP respectively. Therefore (N-1) cycles of beta-oxidation will produce (N-1) FADH2 and (N-1) NADH.\nThe energetics of \uf062-oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid comprising of 2N carbon atoms can be summarized as follows:\nSo, the net ATP yield after beta-oxidation of a straight-chain fatty acid having 2N carbon atoms will be (14N-4) - 2 = (14N- 6)We must keep in mind that during the initial activation of fatty acids (conversion of fatty acid to fatty acyl CoA), 2 ATP is utilized.\nThis formula can be used to calculate net ATP yield from a straight-chain fatty acid having an even number of carbon atoms. For example,\nNet ATP yield from beta-oxidation of palmitic acid (16 carbon) will be 106.\n\nCalculation: Here, 2N = 16 i.e, N = 8 .

Leukotrienes are produced from the breakdown of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase via the lipoxygenase pathway.\n\n\n\nLeukotrienes are eicosanoic acid derivatives formed in leukocytes, mast cells, platelets, and macrophages. They are potent constrictors of the bronchial airway. Leukotrienes also cause increased vascular permeability and activation and attraction of leukocytes. Thus, they are involved in many inflammatory or immediate hypersensitivity reactions, such as asthma.\n\n\n\nHydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) is the first intermediate product produced in the LOX pathway.\n5-lipoxygenase, the first enzyme of the LOX pathway, breaks down arachidonic acid into\n5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) which undergoes further chemical reactions to produce leukotrienes (LTs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and lipoxins.\n\n\n\n\nMetabolism of Acylglycerols and Sphingolipids\n",

The most important source of NADPH is the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) pathway.\nThe HMP shunt pathway, or pentose phosphate pathway, is an alternative route for the metabolism of glucose. It generates NADPH and synthesizes ribose. NADP+ is hydrogenated to NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Since the HMP shunt pathway and de novo fatty acid synthesis both occur in the cytosol of the cell, there are no membranes or permeability barriers against the transfer of NADPH. Thus, this forms the major source for NADPH for fatty acid synthesis.\nOther minor sources of NADPH are extramitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADP malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme).\n\n\n",

In the well fed state, there is an abundant supply of glucose, which is converted to pyruvate, which in turn is converted to acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is diverted into fatty acid synthesis, in which acetyl CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme. There is also a high insulin : glucagon ratio in the well fed state. This favors dephosphorylation (activation) of acetyl CoA carboxylase, resulting in increased fatty acid synthesis. The fatty acids thus formed (most commonly palmitoyl CoA) are esterified into triacylglycerols. This process is called lipogenesis.\nNote: The enzymes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, thiolase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I are involved in fatty acid oxidation and are inactive in the well-fed state.\n\n\n",

It is formed from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. During fatty acid synthesis, acetyl CoA primarily acts as the primer. The enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to the inital acetyl-CoA, forming a 4-carbon intermediate (butyryl-ACP). FAS then sequentially adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to the ACP-intermediates (eg: butyryl-ACP) to elongate the fatty acid chain.\nThus, in the end product palmitic acid (C16), only carbon atoms 15 and 16 are from acetyl CoA. The remaining 14 carbon atoms are derived from malonyl-CoA. Thus, malonyl-CoA is the most active donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis.\nNote:\nOption 3: Fatty acid synthesis is not a simple reversal of oxidation of fatty acids. These two processes involve completely different enzymes and occur in different compartments of the cell.\nOption 4: Intermediates in fatty acid synthesis are covalently linked to the sulfhydryl group of\nan acyl carrier protein (ACP), not coenzyme A, of the enzyme fatty acid synthase. Intermediates in the fatty acid breakdown are covalently attached to the sulfhydryl group of coenzyme A.\n\n\n",

It is caused by a deficiency of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine.\nDipalmitoyl lecithin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a major component of lung surfactant. In DPPC, positions 1 &amp; 2 on the glycerol are occupied by palmitate. Surfactant is secreted by the type 2 pneumocytes in the alveoli. It reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveolus and increases compliance.\nMature levels of surfactant are present after 35 weeks of gestation. Thus, preterm babies are at risk of surfactant deficiency, leading to infant respiratory distress syndrome. Lung maturity of the fetus can be assessed by determining the ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin (L:S ratio) in the amniotic fluid. A ratio of &gt;2 indicates maturity.\nOther options -\nOption 1: Phosphatidylethanolamine, also called cephalin, is found in the cell membranes of nervous tissue, particularly in the brain.\nOption 3: Diphosphatidyl glycerol, also called cardiolipin, is found in the inner membrane of mitochondria and plays a key role in apoptosis.\nOption 4: Phosphatidylinositol present in the cell membrane acts as a precursor of hormone secondary messengers and platelet-activating factor.\n",

Familial Hyperchylomicronemia is also associated with hepatosplenomegaly, pancreatitis and eruptive/pruritic xanthoma. Serum biochemistry commonly reveals increased chylomicron, triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the blood.\nChylomicron has the lowest mobility on serum lipid electrophoresis and the chylomicron band appears at the origin location (initial location).

It is due to a defect in the active transport of bilirubin across the canalicular membrane, due to a mutation in the MRP-2 protein. It is also known as black liver jaundice due to the accumulation of a dark pigment, derived from epinephrine metabolites, in the lysosomes of centrilobular hepatocytes.

Gilbert syndrome most commonly occurs due to promoter defect of the UGT1A1 enzyme.\nGilbert syndrome is caused by a defect in the promoter region of the gene coding for the\nUDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) enzyme. This results in a variable rate of transcription of the normal enzyme. UGT1A1 activity is reduced to 10-33% of normal. It presents with periods of mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with other liver function tests being normal. The disorder is precipitated by stress, alcohol and reduced caloric intake.\n\nLiver histology shows increased lipofuscin pigment. It responds well to phenobarbitone. Gilbert's syndrome doesn't require treatment. The bilirubin levels may fluctuate over time, and patients may occasionally have jaundice, which usually resolves on its own with no ill effects.\n\n\n\n\nUrine urobilinogen is not increased in obstructive jaundice. Obstructive jaundice has the following features:\nAbsent urinary urobilinogen: In complete obstruction of the biliary tree, conjugated bilirubin cannot enter the intestine. Thus it is not metabolized by the intestinal flora and urobilinogen is not formed.\nIncreased serum direct bilirubin: Due to obstruction in the biliary tree, the bilirubin conjugates diffuse into the blood causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\nIncreased urine bilirubin: Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and thus appears in the urine in excess amounts.\nOption A: Urine bilirubin is absent in hemolytic jaundice because unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble.\nOption C: Criggler-Najjar syndrome, due to absent UGT1A1 activity, presents with raised unconjugated bilirubin.\nOption D: Hepatocellular jaundice can have decreased urine urobilinogen if micro-obstruction occurs due to swollen, damaged hepatocytes.\n\nEnzymes - Mechanism of Action & Clinical Importance\n",

Raw: Question 19:\n\nGibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is given by\n\n\n\n\nB\nA\nC\nD\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nAmong the given graphs, the Gibbs free energy change of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is shown by graph A (Option B).\nGraph B (Option A) cannot represent the Gibbs free energy of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, as the energy state of an intermediate cannot be lower than the product. A lower energy state of th intermediate implies that the enzyme-intermediate complex is stable and such a complex will usually not further form a product.\nDuring any chemical reaction, the product is formed by the breaking of substrate bonds and the conformational change of the substrate into a highly unstable transition state. This transition state is denoted by the peak of the graph. The Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (with no intermediate state) is shown in the image given below:\n\n\n\nThe below graph shows the normal intermediate formation with an energy state still higher than that of the product:\n\n\nAll the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. Every intermediate state is again always followed by another transition state.\nActivation energy is the energy difference between the free energy of the substrates and that of the transition state. Because of the high activation energy, the rates of uncatalyzed chemical reactions are often slow.\n\n\n\n\nIn an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the activation energy is reduced by forming a relatively stable intermediate-enzyme complex. Enzymes provide attachment sites for the substrate and speed up the rate of reaction. They don't change the energy state of either the substrate or the product. The Gibbs free energy change remains the same.\nGraph C: Free energy change cannot be a straight line. Every reaction passes through a high-energy intermediate transition state.\nGraph D: The activation energy of any reaction is never lower than the free energy of the product.\n\n\n\nThe highest catalytic efficiency is seen when Km= 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec.\nCatalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km, where Km is inversely proportional to the binding affinity of the enzyme and Kcat is the catalytic constant (Vmax divided by the total number of active sites of the enzyme present). Higher values of Kcat and lower values of Km gives better catalytic efficiency. Catalytic efficiency can be used to compare the performance of 2 different enzymes in catalyzing a reaction.\nStep 1: Km of each option after converting respective units to moles will be 10, 2, 2 and 4 (each multiplied by 10-6) moles.\nStep 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km. On substituting the values in various options after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 100 and 50 (each multiplied by 106) M-1 s-1.\nSome enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They are limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These are called diffusion-limited enzymes and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 108 M-1 s-1.\n\nFat soluble vitamins\n\n",

As the substrate concentration increases, initial velocity (Vi) increases until it reaches a maximum value Vmax.

This is because the enzyme is saturated with th substrate.\nThe Michaelis constant (Km) is the substrate concentration at which Vi is half the maximal velocity i.e. Vmax/2.

Thus, the rate of this reaction is equal to Vmax and is thus independent of the substrate concentration i.e. it follows zero-order kinetics. Thus, doubling the substrate concentration does not change the velocity of the reaction i.e. it remains as Vmax.\nNo matter the substrate concentration, the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the enzyme. In this situation the enzyme concentration becomes 1/3rd. Thus, the velocity of the reaction (Vmax) also becomes 1/3rd.

Hence, the galactose tolerance test is done to assess the functional capacity of the liver.\nIn liver dysfunction, galactose is excreted in the urine in increased amounts. The liver function is measured as the rate of excretion of galactose in urine following the\ningestion or intravenous injection of a known amount of galactose.\nNormally, less than 3 g appear in the urine within 5 hours after the ingestion of 40 g of galactose.\n\n\n",

Preservation of intelligence is the feature of this syndrome. It is characterized by macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, macroglossia, short stature, and contractures.\nNaglazyme is used as an enzyme replacement therapy.\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario of a child with easy fatiguability, irritability, and inability to concentrate with the images showing a crumpled tissue paper appearance(Gaucher's cell) is suggestive of Gaucher's disease. The deficient enzyme is glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta-glucosidase). I\nGaucher's disease is an inborn error of metabolism caused due to a deficiency of beta glucocerebrosidase. It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder and the mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. There is an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen, liver, and other tissues.\nThere are three clinical subtypes - type I (chronic non-neuronopathic), type II (acute neuronopathic), and type III (intermediate). Clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological features depending on the subtype.\nGaucher's cells - These are formed as a result of the accumulation of massive amounts of glucocerebrosides within the phagocytes. The cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm and give a crumpled tissue paper appearance.\n\nOption A: Deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A is seen in Tay-Sachs disease. The deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A and B causes Sandhoff's disease. Clinical features are seizures, macrocephaly, and hyperacusis.\nOption C: Deficiency of sphingomyelinase leads to Niemann-Pick disease. It is characterized by the presence of foam cells in the bone marrow. There may be pulmonary infiltrates leading to lung failure.\nOption D: Deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminidase leads to Sanfillipo's disease. It is a type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS - III).

When heated in the presence of an alkali, they are converted to enediols, which reduce the cupric compounds (Cu2+) present in Benedict's reagent to an insoluble precipitate of red cuprous oxide (Cu2O).\n\n\nComposition of Benedict\u2019s reagent:\nCopper sulfate: Provides the source of cupric (Cu2+) ions\nSodium citrate: Complexes with cupric (Cu2+) ions to prevent its deterioration to cuprous ions spontaneously\nSodium carbonate: Provides an alkaline pH Substances giving a positive reaction on Benedict\u2019s test:\nAll monosaccharides such as glucose, galactose, fructose, pentoses\nReducing disaccharides such as lactose and maltose\nGlucuronic acid, homogentisic acid, and ascorbic acid\nClinical correlate: Benedict's test is used to detect the presence of glucose in urine.\nThe color of the precipitate gives a rough idea of the amount of sugar present in urine. Hence, it is a semi-quantitative test.\n\nColour of the precipitate\nAmount of reducing sug ar\nGreen\n0.5%\n\u0192ellow\n1%\nOrange\n1.5%\nRed\n2%\n\n\n",

It is the metabolically active tissue in the body.\nThe BMR decreases with increasing age, even when body weight remains constant. This is the result of muscle tissue replacement by adipose tissue, which is metabolically less active. Women have a significantly lower BMR than men of the same body weight and age.

It is activated in the following steps:\nSkin: 7-Dehydrocholesterol (an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol in the skin) undergoes a nonenzymic reaction on exposure to ultraviolet light (290nm to 315nm), yielding cholecalciferol.\nLiver: Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (the most abundant circulatory form of Vitamin D) by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase.\nKidney: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is converted to 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the biologically active form by the enzyme 1\uf061-hydroxylase.\n\n\nCalcitriol acts on the bone, intestine, and kidney to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis.

It is associated with a deficiency of vitamin E.\nThe most important function of vitamin E is its chain-breaking antioxidant role. Vitamin E inhibits lipid peroxidation by free radicals, thereby stabilizing cell membranes. Hence, its deficiency can result in erythrocyte membranes being abnormally fragile leading to hemolytic anemia.\n\n\nNote: Vitamin K deficiency does not cause hemolysis. It causes manifestations of impaired coagulation, such as easy bruisability, mucosal bleeding, etc. However, vitamin K toxicity can\n\ncause hemolysis.\n\n\n",

This is due to the loss of normal bowel flora that synthesizes menaquinones (vitamin K2).\nVitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. The following are the vitamers of vitamin K:\nPhylloquinone (Vitamin K1) is the normal dietary source of Vitamin K that is found in green vegetables.\nMenaquinones (Vitamin K2) are synthesized by intestinal bacteria.\nMenadione (Vitamin K3) is a synthetic compound that is metabolized to phylloquinone.\n\n\n\nWarfarin, which is an oral anticoagulant drug inhibits gamma-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, but not factor VIII.

In the retina, a form of vitamin A called retinal (11-cis retinaldehyde) plays an important role in Wald's visual cycle. Its deficiency leads to vision defects.\nRhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, consists of 11-cis retinal specifically bound to the protein opsin. When rhodopsin is exposed to light, a series of photochemical isomerizations occurs. This results in the bleaching of the visual pigment and release of\nall-trans-retinal and opsin. This process triggers a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain.\nThe image given below shows Wald's visual cycle.\n\n\n\n\n",

Why should niacin be used cautiously in this patient?\nIt can cause hyperglycemia.\nIt can cause scleroderma which makes injecting insulin difficult.\nIt can increase the metabolism of oral hypoglyemic drugs.\nIt can cause hypoglycemia.\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nNiacin should be used cautiously in diabetics as it can cause hyperglycemia.\nNiacin induces insulin resistance and also decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,\nwhich may result in severe hyperglycemia. When niacin is prescribed for patients with known or suspected diabetes, blood glucose levels should be monitored at least once a week.\n\n\n",

It is caused by niacin/vitamin B3 deficiency. Hence, one should ask for a history of diarrhea and memory loss in this case.\nPellagra presents with 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and if untreated, Death. Early symptoms of pellagra are loss of appetite, generalized weakness and irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Photosensitive dermatitis is seen over sun-exposed areas. Diarrhea occurs due to proctitis or malabsorption. Bright red glossitis (beefy tongue) and Casal\u2019s necklace (a pigmented, scaly skin rash that forms a ring around the neck) follow. Depressive psychosis and dementia also commonly occur.\nCorn/ maize/ jowar based diets are the main causes of niacin deficiency. Corn/maize lacks niacin and tryptophan. The excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Niacin deficiency is also seen in alcoholism. Hence, additional histories of diarrhea and memory loss will aid in supporting the diagnosis of pellagra (along with dietary history).\nTreatment includes oral supplementation with 100\u2013200 mg of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid three times daily for 5 days.\nOption B: Thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) features include CVS manifestations like heart failure and edema (wet beriberi), peripheral neuritis (dry beriberi), and Wernicke encephalopathy (in alcoholics).\nOption C: Dermatitis seen in pellagra is due to dietary deficiency of niacin and so allergy history is not relevant.\nOption D: Conjunctivitis is not a feature of niacin deficiency.\n\n\n",

All of the following statements about this drug are true except:\nIt inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue\nIt causes a reduction in the liver TAG synthesis\nIt reduces the level of HDL\n\nIt reduces the level of LDL\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 14:\nNiacin increases the level of HDL.\nNiacin (vitamin B3) is known to inhibit lipolysis within the adipose tissue. Hence, the circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) are reduced. The liver normally uses these circulating FFAs as a precursor in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). As a result, niacin causes a reduction in liver TAG synthesis. TAGs are in turn required for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) synthesis. Therefore both plasma VLDL and LDL values are reduced. Overall, niacin decreases LDL, VLDL and TAG levels, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Thus it is particularly useful in the treatment of type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both VLDL and LDL are elevated.\n\n\n",

This is because a protein called avidin present in the egg-white binds to biotin in the diet and makes biotin unavailable for intestinal absorption. Biotin deficiency can cause dermatitis, mental status changes (depression, hallucinations), paraesthesia and alopecia.\nBiotin serves as a co-enzyme for the synthesis of several carboxylase enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl CoA carboxylase and methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase.

However, the absorption of both inorganic and heme iron is impaired by calcium. So, a glass of milk with a meal significantly reduces iron availability.\n\n\n\nThe beading of ribs in scurvy is sharp and tender.\nA deficiency state of vitamin C results in scurvy.

Raw: Question 2:\n\nWhich of the following patients is likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency?\nA 40-year-old male with a segmental resection of primary duodenal cancer\nAn intestinal obstruction case with jejunectomy due to necrotic segment\nA 30-year-old patient who got his ileum removed due to Crohn's disease\nA 62-year-old patient who underwent colectomy for ulcerative colitis\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 2:\nA 30-year-old patient who got his ileum removed due to Crohn's disease is likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum via receptors known as cubulin, which binds the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex.\nDietary vitamin B12 is normally bound to proteins in food. Pepsin and gastric acid in the stomach degrade these food proteins and release vitamin B12. The free vitamin B12 then binds to a salivary glycoprotein called haptocorrin (R-binder).\nIn the alkaline pH of the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade the haptocorrin, and vitamin B12 is released again. It then binds tightly to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach and this binding takes place in the duodenum. The IF-Vitamin B12 complex reaches the terminal ileum and attaches to a receptor on the enterocyte, from where it is absorbed. Vitamin B12 is transported in the blood bound to a carrier protein called transcobalamin II and delivered to the peripheral tissues.\nAbsorption sites: Iron- Duodenum Folate- Jejunum Vit B12- Ileum\n\n\n\n\n",

Which of the following findings is not seen in this condition?\nDecreased homocysteine levels\nPositive Romberg sign\nOptic atrophy\nDementia\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe clinical scenario of a patient on a vegan diet now presenting with glossitis of the tongue, hyperreflexia, and numbness and tingling in the legs is suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. Decreased homocysteine levels are not seen in this condition. Rather, increased homocysteine levels are seen.\nVitamin B12 is a cofactor of methionine synthase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase. Methionine synthase is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is the principal methyl donor. In vitamin B12 deficiency, defective methionine synthase leads to the following:\nIn the absence of methionine, there is decreased methylation in the CNS. This leads to defective synthesis of myelin and neurotransmitters, which results in the following symptoms :\nPosterolateral cord degeneration: It presents as loss of proprioception and vibration, positive Romberg sign, ataxia, hyperreflexia, spasticity\nDementia leading to cognitive impairment\nPeripheral neuropathy: presenting as muscle weakness, paraesthesia\nOptic atrophy\nHomocysteine accumulates in the blood conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nMegaloblastic anemia: The availability of 5,10-methylene THF is reduced, which is required in the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine monophosphate (TMP) for DNA synthesis.

This leads to defective copper-binding P-type ATPase and copper is not mobilized from the intestine. Thus copper deficiency occurs and enzymes containing copper are affected, like superoxide dismutase, dopamine hydroxylase and amine oxidase.\nGlutathione peroxidase is not affected since it requires selenium in the form of selenocysteine.\nOther copper deficiency disorders include Wilson's disease and MEDNIK syndrome. Wilson\u2019s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, due to ATP7B mutation, a gene encoding for copper transporting ATPase in the cells. There is defective biliary copper excretion from liver cells, leading to copper deposits in the liver and brain.

He is confused and has a slurred speech. His blood ethanol levels are 220 mg/dl and his glucose levels are 45 mg/dL. The toxic effects of the substance consumed by this patient are due to which of the following?\nDecreased lactate/pyruvate ratio\nStimulation of gluconeogenesis\nIncreased NADH/NAD+ ratio\nStimulation of fatty acid oxidation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nConfusion and slurred speech with elevated blood ethanol levels suggests ethanol intoxication. The toxicity of ethanol is due to the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio.\nEthanol is metabolised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase. This reaction generates NADH. A high concentration of NADH leads to a high NADH/NAD+ ratio. Due to this, the metabolic reactions which require NAD+ are inhibited. This is the basic cause of all the metabolic effects of alcohol.\nGlycolysis, citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation are inhibited. Ketogenesis is favoured. Pyruvate is shunted for lactate synthesis due to abundance of NADHand lactate/pyruvate ratio increases. Thus gluconeogenesis, which requires pyruvate as a substratre, is inhibited. This leads\n\nto hypoglycemia.\n\n\n",

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\nGout\nLesch Nyhan Syndrome\nXanthinuria\nOrotic aciduria\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given clinical picture is highly suggestive of orotic aciduria. The compound given in the image is orotic acid.\nOrotic aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive condition. The deficiency of UMP synthase causes type-1 orotic aciduria. Type-2 orotic aciduria is caused by the deficiency of orotidylate decarboxylase. It manifests usually in the first year of life and presents with growth failure, developmental retardation, megaloblastic anemia and increased urinary excretion of orotic acid.\nSevere megaloblastic anemia with normal serum B12 and folic acid levels suggests this condition. A presumptive diagnosis is made by checking increased urinary excretion of orotic acid.\nConfirmation is done by enzyme assays of transferase and decarboxylase of erythrocytes. The anemia only responds to the administration of uridine. Allopurinol and 6-azauridine may precipitate this condition.\nOther options:\nOption A and B: In gout and Lesch Nyhan syndrome uric acid crystals are excreted. Option C: In xanthinuria, xanthine crystals are excreted.\n\n\nThe above given clinical findings is suggestive of xeroderma pigmentosum. Defect in the removal of oligonucleotides containing the damaged bases by endonucleases is seen in xeroderma pigmentosum.\nXeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by defective DNA repair which leads to clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and other carcinogenic agents.\nImportant clinical features are:\n\nIntense cutaneous photosensitivity, xerosis, poikiloderma, actinic keratosis, acute burning under minimal sun exposure, erythemas, hyperpigmented lentiginous macules, and malignant lesions in sun-exposed areas, including basocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\nThe final diagnosis of XP can be confirmed by special laboratory tests by examining the DNA damage repair in cells from cultures exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The most common tests are skin biopsy and culture of skin fibroblasts.\nThere is no cure for XP. Treatment consists of minimizing exposure to sunlight and regular dermatological care, as well as surgery for recurrent tumors excision. Patients should be followed up every 3 months. Genetic counseling is important in a family that has an affected child and is considering having more children.\n\nDNA organization, replication and repair\n",

This deficiency results in an inability to salvage hypoxanthine or guanine, from which excessive amounts of uric acid is produced and excreted in urine as orange sands.\nClinical features include compulsive self-mutilation, hyperuricemia, intellectual disability, delayed milestones, dystonic movements and megaloblastic anemia.\nDiagnosis is made by deficient HGPRTase enzyme activity in the erythrocyte. Partial deficiency of HGPRTase cause Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome.\nOther options:\nOption A: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme deficiency causes urinary calculus formation with crystalluria.\nOption C: Adenosine deaminase enzyme deficiency is one of the 2nd major cause of SCID.\nOption D: Purine nucleoside phosphorylase causes a severe deficiency of T cells but B cells are normal.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 27:\n\nChimeric DNA is associated with:\nPaternity test\nMaternity test\nPersonal identification\nOrgan transplantation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 27:\nChimeric DNA is associated with organ transplantation, especially bone-marrow transplantation.\n\nIn organ transplantation, chimeric DNA refers to the mixture of donor and recipient genetic material that occurs when donor cells begin functioning within the recipient's body. It is used for long-term monitoring of bone marrow transplant recipients. Detecting changes in the levels of donor-derived cells can provide early warning signs of graft failure, rejection, or relapse of underlying disease.\nNote: The practical applications of recombinant DNA technology include:\nGene mapping using techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nProducing proteins such as:\nInterferons, tPA (tissue plasminogen activator)\nInsulin, growth hormone\nHepatitis B vaccine\nMolecular analysis of disease, to detect gene variations and mutations.\nRestriction Fragment Length polymorphism (RFLP) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)\nMicrosatellite DNA polymorphisms\nGene therapy and bone marrow transplantation\n\n\n\nThe false statement is that telomerase is involved in DNA repair.\nTelomeres are the end of chromosomal DNA. Since prokaryotic DNA is circular, it does not have free ends and hence no telomeres. Thus, telomeres are present only in eukaryotes Telomeres have TG- rich repeats and usually do not code for any proteins. With every DNA replication during cell division, telomere shortening occurs. Once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in length, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of times a cell can divide.\nIn stem cells and cancer cells, an enzyme telomerase having reverse transcriptase activity (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby preserving chromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more number of times than a normal adult cell.\n\nRNA synthesis, processing and modification\n",

During denaturation, the hydrogen bonds are broken. The phosphodiester bond is not broken. DNA's secondary and teriary structures are also broken, butthe primary structure is not altered. As DNA gets denatured, its viscosity decreases. Denatured DNA also shows hyperchromicity at 260nm, which is the increase in absorbance of UV light showed by nitrogenous bases.\n\n\n",

They contain four major types of histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones are a small family of closely related basic protein composed of arginine and lysine. H3 and H4 form a tetramer while H2A and H2B form dimers; these histone oligomers associate to form the histone octamer. These four core histones are subject to at least six types of covalent modification or post-translational modifications - acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation,\nADP-ribosylation, monoubiquitylation and sumoylation.\nH1 histone is seen in the linker region between nucleosomes and is bound loosely to the nucleosome.\n\n\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 21:\n\nThe process of apolipoprotein B48 synthesis involves which of the following?\nRNA alternate splicin\nRNA editin\nDNA editin\nRNA interference\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe process of apolipoprotein B48 synthesis involves RNA editing.\nRNA editing is the process by which the coding sequence of the mRNA is changed before translation. As a result, the mRNA template differs from the DNA from which it was transcribed. This leads to the formation of a different protein. This occurs by insertion of additional uracils at the 3\u2019 end of the mRNA and proceeds in 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 direction.\nRNA editing in apoB synthesis:\nIn the liver, the apoB gene is transcribed to mRNA which is then translated to apoB 100.\nIn the intestine, the same apoB gene is transcribed to the same mRNA. But now, the mRNA undergoes editing by an enzyme cytidine deaminase which converts the CAA codon in the mRNA to UAA at a single specific site. This edited mRNA translates to apoB 48.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the given options, using primers W and Y will yield the desired product A.\nPromoters or DNA regulatory elements usually precedes the desired exon to be transcribed. It helps redirect transcription of only the desired exons of a gene to yield a product. Alternative splicing utilizes different promoters to code slightly different products from the same gene.\nIn this question, the desired product A has segments 1,3,4,5 whilst the other product B has 1,2,4,5. The difference between both is the presence of seg 3 in product A and the presence of seg 2 in product B. As the product in question is A, only seg 3 is required while excluding seg 2 and ensuring seg 1,4 and 5 intact.\nSeg 1- Needs to be transcribed and so W is essential\nSeg 2- Does not need to be transcribed.\nSeg 3- Needs to be transcribed and so Y is essential\nSeg 4- Needs to be transcribed but Z is not essential as Y continues the transcription in the direction shown by the arrow.\nThe answer is hence promoter W and Y.\n\nRegulation of gene expression\n\n",

Therefore, methylation is an epigenetic modification that inactivates DNA, and hinders the formation of euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). Epigenetic changes include alterations of chromatin structure by:\nMethylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides\nModification of histones by acetylation or methylation\nChanges in higher-order chromosome structure\nSumoylation of histones (SUMO - Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) is associated with transcription repression. Other possible roles of posttranslationally modified histones:\nAcetylation of core histones is associated with chromosomal assembly during DNA replication.\nPhosphorylation of histone H1 is associated with the condensation of chromosomes during the replication cycle.\nADP-ribosylation of histones is associated with DNA repair.\nMethylation of histones is correlated with activation and repression of gene transcription.\nAcetylation of histones H3 and H4 is associated with the activation or inactivation of gene transcription.\nMonoubiquitylation is associated with gene activation, repression, and heterochromatic gene silencing.\n\n\n\nDNA methylation is not involved in the base pair excision repair mechanism (statement 4) and RNA splicing (statement 2).\nDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification used as a gene expression regulation mechanism. It causes gene silencing by inactivating DNA and hindering the formation of euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). Thus, it also aids in chromatin remodelling.\nIt however is not involved in the base pair repair mechanism or RNA splicing.\n\n\n\nMolecular genetics, recombinant DNA & genomic technology\n",

Thus, the applications of PCR to forensic medicine are obvious. DNA fingerprinting, or DNA profiling, is used for forensic analysis of crime scenes and paternity testing (Option D).\nOther options:\nOption A: Short Tandem Repeat (STR) are short sequences of DNA at scattered locations in the genome, repeated in tandem (one after the other). E.g., CG-CG-CG-CG-CG.

It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is referred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis.\nT e first base of the anticodon moves to permit nontraditional pairing with the last base of the codon. This movement is called wobble and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is not as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 6\u2030 tRNA species are not required to read the 6\u2030 codons.\nFor example, three codons for glycine\u2014GGU, GGC, and GGA\u2014can form a base pair from one anticodon, 3\uf0a2 CCI 5\uf0a2 ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below.\nOther options:\nOption A: The genetic code is universal because it is the same for all living organisms.\n\nOption B: The genetic code is unambiguous because each codon is specific for only one amino acid. Example: GGA only codes for Glycine.\nOption D: The genetic code is non-punctuated. This means that once the reading commences at a specific start codon, it is continuous and is read continuously as triplets until a stop codon is reached without stopping.\n",

Hence, glycolysis in erythrocytes always ends in the formation of lactate. Also, anaerobic glycolysis is the major fate for pyruvate in the lens and cornea of the eye, kidney medulla, leukocytes, because these are all poorly vascularized structures.\nNet ATP produced per molecule of glucose under anaerobic conditions is 2.

Deficiency of which of the following glycolytic enzymes is most likely associated with this presentation?\nEnolase\nPyruvate kinase\nAconitase\nPhosphofructokinase-1\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nDeficiency of pyruvate kinase leads to hemolytic anemia.\n\nErythrocytes lack mitochondria and hence generate ATP exclusively via glycolysis. In a glycolytic enzyme deficiency, there is a reduced rate of glycolysis, leading to decreased ATP production. This results in a few alterations in the RBC membrane, thereby leading to changes in cell shape. Such deformed RBCs are later phagocytosed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and this results in a state of hemolytic anemia.\nThe most common enzyme deficiency causing hemolytic anemia is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (pentose phosphate pathway).\nThe second most common enzyme deficiency causing hemolytic anemia is the pyruvate kinase.

Hence, there is more oxygen release in conditions like hypoxia.\n2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is hydrolyzed to 3-phosphoglycerate and Pi by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase and no ATP is generated.\nSince the reaction catalysed by 1, 3- Bisphosphoglycerate kinase is bypassed, no ATPs are produced in that step. Only 2 ATPs are generated by the pyruvate kinase step and 2 ATPs are utilized in the steps catalyzed by hexokinase and PFK-1. Anaerobic glycolysis takes place due to the absence of mitochondria. So this pathway yields no net generation of ATP from glycolysis.\n",

This effect was termed the Warburg effect.\nThe increased rate of glycolysis is due to certain defects in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Besides, this enhanced glycolysis enables the cancer cells to proliferate in the reduced oxygen tension conditions, which is seen in tumors. This switch from aerobic to anaerobic glucose metabolism also acts as an impetus to tumorigenesis.\nThe increased glucose consumption is used as a carbon source for anabolic processes needed to support cell proliferation such as the de novo generation of nucleotides, lipids, and proteins. Also, the major isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase in cancer cells is PK-2 (in contrast to PK-1 in normal cells), which appears to play a role in the Warburg effect.\nNote: This effect is the basis for detecting cancers by FDG-PET scanning.\n\n\n",

This alanine is shunted out into the circulation, and later on into the liver. Here in the liver, another round of transamination takes place, and the alanine is reconverted back into pyruvate. This pyruvate serves as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. This entire pathway has been called as the Cahill\u2019s cycle or the glucose\u2013alanine pathway.\n\n\n",

The semipermeable inner mitochondrial membrane is permeable to malate.\nIn glycolysis, the impermeable NADH produced in the cytosol (of liver and cardiac cells) are taken up into mitochondria in the form of malate for oxidation via malate shuttle.\nIn gluconeogenesis, pyruvate in the mitochondria generates impermeable oxaloacetate, which is converted to aspartate and translocated to the cytosol via malate shuttle for the synthesis of glucose.\n\n\n",

A deficiency of this enzyme causes the accumulation of glycogen in vacuoles in the lysosomes. This is called type II GSD or Pompe\u2019s disease.\nGlycogen storage disorders that are associated with the following findings:\nLiver cirrhosis: Types III, IV, IX GSD\nRenal dysfunction: Type I GSD\nNeurologic involvement: Type II GSD\nNote: Another GSD that is also a lysosomal storage disorder is Danon disease (or glycogen storage disease Type IIb)\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 7:\n\nA \u00e7\u017d-year-old woman was found to have excessive urinary glucose levels. However, her blood glucose levels were normal. Further investigations revealed high levels of only L-xylulose in the urine. A genetic defect in which of the following pathways is most likely?\nKrebs cycle\n\u00e8ronic acid pathway\nKetone synthesis\nHMP Shunt\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nHigh levels of L-xylulose in urine point to a diagnosis of essential pentosuria. It is a benign condition caused due to a defect in the uronic acid pathway.\nEssential pentosuria has no clinical consequences. However, it can give false-positive results when urinary glucose is measured using alkaline copper reagents (Benedict\u2019s test).\nThe lack of enzyme xylulose reductase of the uronic acid pathway leads to essential Pentosuria. Affected individuals excrete large amounts of L-xylulose in urine. Xylulose being a reducing sugar gives Benedict's test positive. Bial's test is positive as xylulose is a pentose.\nEssential pentosuria is a part of Garrod's tetrad which includes :\nPentosuria\nAlbinism\nCystinuria\nAlkaptonuria\n",

This enzyme does not act on glucose and, unlike glucokinase, its activity is not affected by fasting or by insulin, which may explain why fructose is cleared from the blood of diabetic patients at a normal rate.\nDeficiency of fructokinase results in essential fructosuria.\n\n\n\n\n",

The protein synthetic apparatus can identify a selenocysteine-encoding UGA by the presence of the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the untranslated region of mRNA.\nSelenocysteine is an analog of cysteine and is synthesized from serine.\nSelenocysteine is present at the active site of several human enzymes that catalyze redox reactions such as thioredoxin reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and deiodinase. Since Glutathione peroxidase contains selenocysteine and hence it is an antioxidant.\nImpairments in human selenoproteins have been implicated in tumorigenesis and atherosclerosis and are associated with selenium deficiency cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease).\n\n\n",

Consumption of food products with choline should be avoided in fish odor syndrome.\nFish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria) is an autosomal recessive disease where TMA(trimethylamine) is not converted to the non-odorous TMAO (TMA-N-oxide) in the liver. This is due to the deficiency of flavin-containing mono oxygenase 3 (FMO3). TMA then builds up in the body and is released in sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong odor of rotting fish from the body.\nCholine, lecithin, and TMAO are precursors of trimethylamine which are found in food products.

In Wilson's disease the amount of conjugated amino acids far exceeds the amount of free amino acids. Methyl Histidine largely exists in free form and does not increase in amount on hydrolysis of acids in urine. Hence low amounts is seen in Wilson's disease.\nWilson disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. The ATP7B gene, encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, expressed on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.\nDeficiency in the ATP7B protein causes a decrease in copper excretion into the bile, impairs its incorporation into ceruloplasmin, and inhibits ceruloplasmin secretion into the blood, leading to the accumulation of toxic levels of copper in the liver, brain, and eye.\n\n\n\nUrine turning black on exposure to air is suggestive of alkaptonuria which occurs due to the defect in homogentisate oxidase enzyme.\nAlkaptonuria is a disorder of tyrosine metabolism, that develops due to the defect in homogentisate oxidase, which oxidizes homogentisate to maleylacetoacetate. The defect in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of homogentisate, which is then excreted in the urine. The excreted homogentisate gets oxidized when exposed to the air and causes the urine to turn black.\nIn some cases, the excessive homogentisate may get oxidized to benzoquinone acetate, which binds to the connective tissue. This leads to arthritis and pigmentation of the connective tissue, a condition called ochronosis.\nOther options:\nOption B: Xanthine oxidase deficiency results in hypouricemia, xanthinuria, and xanthine lithiasis.\nOption C: Defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase can lead to phenylketonuria characterised by hyperreflexia, seizures, hypopigmentation, low IQ, hyperactivity, and tremors.\nOption D: Defects in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are rarely seen in clinical practice. Miller syndrome is associated with this defect.\n\nProtein structure and function\n\n",

The X-ray image of the spine is shown. What is the most probable diagnosis?\n\n\nPhenylketonuria\nAlkaptonuria\nMaple syrup urine disease\nTyrosinemia\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe given clinical images show the accumulation of blackish discoloration on the face and the X-Ray shows calcification of the intervertebral discs. These findings are associated with alkaptonuria.\nAlkaptonuria is a condition caused due to the deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase. This results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid.\nThis condition is associated with the following symptoms:\nBlack ochronotic pigmentation (Alkapton bodies) of cartilage and collagenous tissue\nHomogentisic aciduria (patient\u2019s urine contains elevated levels of homogentisic acid, which is oxidized to a dark pigment on standing)\nLarge joint arthritis\nCalcification of intervertebral discs known as as ochronotic spondyloarthropathy\n\n\n",
