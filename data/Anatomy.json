It is caused due to insufficient formation of mesoderm in the caudal most region of the embryo.\nThe mesoderm in the caudal region is involved in the formation of lower limbs, urogenital system, and lumbosacral vertebrae. Therefore, the defects seen in this condition include hypoplasia and fusion of the lower limbs, vertebral abnormalities, renal agenesis, imperforate anus, and anomalies of the genital organs.\nDuring the third week of development, a process called gastrulation occurs which leads to the formation of all three germ layers. The process begins with the formation of the primitive streak, which develops into the primitive node and primitive pit. The primitive pit further invaginates and organizes itself into cells arranged in three layers, which eventually develop into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nGastrulation related abnormalities:\nSacrococcygeal teratomas occur due to remnants of pluripotent cells from the primitive streak.\nThey are the most common tumor in newborns, occurring at a frequency of 1 in 37,000 births. Sacrococcygeal teratomas contain tissues derived from all three germ layers.\nWhen pluripotent cells from the primitive streak remain in the sacrococcygeal region, they proliferate to form sacrococcygeal teratomas.\nHoloprosencephaly is a deficiency in the midline craniofacial structures. It occurs due to teratogenic exposure (such as high alcohol dose) during gastrulation which kills the cells in the anterior midline of the embryonic disc.

In about 10% of the population, the two ducts do not fuse, resulting in pancreatic divisum (pancreas divisum) where separate drainage into the duodenum is maintained.\nThe image given below shows the development of the pancreas.\nThe annular pancreas occurs when the right portion of the ventral bud migrates along its normal route, but the left migrates in the opposite direction. In this case, the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue.",

Most plasma membranes consist of approximately 50% lipid and 50% protein by weight. The lipid molecules in the cell membrane are predominantly phospholipids. The trilaminar structure of membranes is produced by the arrangement of lipid molecules. Each phospholipid molecule consists of an enlarged head with a phosphate portion and two thin tails. The head end is also called the polar end, while the tail end is the non-polar end. The head end is soluble in water and is said to be hydrophilic. The tail end is insoluble in water and is said to be hydrophobic.",

Thus, an axon-hillock is part of the cell body while the initial segment is part of an axon.\nOption B: Mesaxon refers to the area where the plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself around the axon. During the formation of the myelin sheath, the axon invaginates the Schwann cell. The plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself and continues to wrap\naround the axon to form multiple layers of the plasma membrane called the myelin sheath.

There is no adventitia that differentiates it from a venule.\nThe image below shows the microvessels - arteriole, venule, and capillary.\nThe capillaries can be classified into two types:\nContinuous capillaries - The edges of endothelial cells fuse completely with those of adjoining cells to form a continuous wall. The exchange of material between the blood and tissue occurs through the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells or through the intercellular material adjoining the cells.\nFenestrated capillaries - The walls of these capillaries have apertures in their endothelial lining which are closed by a thin diaphragm. The fenestration may also be present as pores, whic passes through the entire thickness of the cell. The exchange of material occurs by diffusion\nthrough these fenestrae. They are mainly seen in renal glomeruli, intestinal villi, endocrine glands, and pancreas.\nSinusoids differ from the capillaries in that the wall sinusoid has only endothelium, which is supported by a thin layer of connective tissue. The endothelium has larger deficiencies in the form of fenestrations or long slits.",

Arterioles arising from this network leave the trabeculae to pass into the inter-trabecular spaces.\nThe spleen is histologically composed of:\nWhite pulp - For some distance, each arteriole is surrounded by a dense sheath of lymphocytes. These lymphocytes constitute the white pulp of the spleen.\nPenicilli - The arteriole then divides into a number of straight vessels that are called penicilli.\nEllipsoid - Each of the penicilli shows a localised thickening of its wall that is called an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid consists of concentric lamellae formed by aggregation of fibroblasts and macrophages.\nAmpulla - Distal to the ellipsoid, the vessel dilates to form an ampulla, the walls of whic become continuous with the reticular framework.\nRed pulp - As a result, blood flows into spaces lined by reticular cells, coming into direct contact with lymphocytes there. The part of splenic tissue, which is infiltrated with blood in this way is called the red pulp.\nSinusoids - Blood from spaces of the red pulp is collected by wide sinusoids that drain into veins in the trabeculae.\nStave cells: The sinusoids of the spleen are lined by a somewhat modified endothelium.

The endometrium has three layers which are namely:\nStratum compactum,\nStratum spongiosum (which make up the stratum functionalis)\nStratum basalis.\nThe changes observed in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle are continuous and may be summarized as follows:\nIncrease in thickness of endometrium - The endometrium progressively increases in thickness. In the postmenstrual phase, it is 0.5\u20131 mm thick; in the proliferative phase it is 2\u20133 mm thick, and in the secretory phase, its thickness reaches 5\u20137 mm.\nIncrease in dimensions of uterine glands - The uterine glands grow in length. At first, they are straight but gradually become convoluted. Because of these convolutions, the glands acquire a 'saw-toothed' appearance when seen in the longitudinal section. The glands also increase in\ndiameter.\nChange in the epithelial lining of glands - The epithelium lining the glands is at first cuboidal. During the proliferative stage, it becomes columnar.

Hence, the affected nerves include:\nSuprascapular nerve\nAxillary nerve\nMusculocutaneous nerve\nRadial nerve\nErb's palsy has a typical presentation of a policeman's tip or waiter's tip hand deformity. It includes the following features:\nArm is adducted and medially rotated at the shoulder joint\nElbow joint is extended\nRadioulnar joint is pronated\nSensory loss along the outer aspect of the arm\nThe given image below shows classic deformity seen in Erb's palsy.",

    ],
    "correct_option": "b",
    "explanation": "\nThe structure involved in causing lurching gait in the child is gluteus medius (marked as 2).\nThe gluteus medius originates from the outer surface of the ilium between the anterior and posterior gluteal lines. Insertion of the muscle is at the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. It is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve.\nGluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of gluteus medius and minimus:\nWhen the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position.\nThe actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions ike paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc.\nWhen the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive Trendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected side with contralateral pelvis drop.\nOther options\n1 - Gluteus maximus - involved in the extension of flexed thigh, abduction (only upper fibres), and ateral rotation at the hip joint. Insertion is at the iliotibial tract.\n3 - Piriformis - involved in lateral rotation and assists abduction at the hip joint. It is inserted into the medial side of greater trochanter of the femur. Entrapment of the sciatic nerve in the piriformis can lead to piriformis syndrome.\n4 - Sciatic nerve - The nerve passes over the obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior and quadratus femoris. It supplies knee flexors and muscles below the knee. Paralysis of this nerve results in flail foot and severe difficulty in walking.",
