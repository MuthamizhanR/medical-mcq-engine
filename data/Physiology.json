Fast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with\nslow-twitch fibres.\nFast-Twitch and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers\nFast-twitch fibres can deliver extreme amounts of power from a few seconds to a minute.\nThe enzymes that promote rapid release of energy from the phosphagen and glycogen\u2013lactic acid energy systems are more active in fast-twitch fibres.\nFast-twitch fibres are about twice as large in diameter compared with slow-twitch fibres.\nGastrocnemius muscle has a higher preponderance of fast-twitch fibres, which gives it the apability of forceful and rapid contraction of the type used in jumping.\nSlow-twitch fibres are mainly organized for endurance, especially for the generation of aerobi energy.\nThey have far more mitochondria than do the fast-twitch fibres.\nThey contain considerably more myoglobin. The extra myoglobin increases the rate of diffusion of oxygen throughout the fibre.\nThe enzymes of the aerobic metabolic system are considerably more active in slow-twitch fibres.\nThe number of capillaries is greater in the vicinity of slow-twitch fibres.\nSoleus muscle has a higher preponderance of slow-twitch muscle fibres and therefore is used to a greater extent for prolonged lower leg muscle activity."

    "explanation": "\nSignals from joint proprioceptors play a role in stimulating the respiratory drive during exercise. Regulation of respiration in exercise\nDuring strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- fold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly\nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen metabolism.\nPart of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory enter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted into the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors.\nDuring strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. So, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased\narterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.\n [Image Reference: Physiology_img_39.jpeg, Physiology_img_441.jpeg]"

    "explanation": "\nThe fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not hinder it.\nAdaptation at High Altitudes\nThe work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the decrease in O2 uptake. (Option B)\nImmediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and this stimulation increases alveolar ventilation.\nThis immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory alkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased ventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C).\nTo compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase bicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and brings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration.\nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE\nLactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D)\nOrdinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts with oxygen to form many ATP molecules.\nHowever, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and blood."

Effect of Smoking on Pulmonary Ventilation in Exercise\nNicotine causes constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which increases the resistance of air flow into and out of the lungs.\nThe irritating effects of the smoke causes increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree and some degree of swelling of the epithelial linings, which again increases airflow resistance.\nNicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much debris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing.\nAll these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal exercise, and their level of performance may be reduced.\nIn persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be destroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress. Chronic smoking is an important cause of emphysema."
