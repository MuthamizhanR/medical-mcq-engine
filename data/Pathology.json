It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of\nthe acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. This consequentially leads to a decreased transmission at the neuromuscular (myoneural) junction.\nThere is a characteristic pattern of muscle involvement. Lid and extraocular muscles (diplopia and ptosis) are involved early in the disease course. The facial muscles weakness can produce a snarling expression, weakness in chewing, and nasal timbre to the voice. Weakness increases with repeated use of the muscles and improves with rest.

In about half the cases, there is an underlying malignancy; most often, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (Small cell lung carcinoma). The stimulus for autoantibody formation in paraneoplastic cases may be the expression of the same calcium channel in the neoplastic cells.\nPatients without cancer often have other autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo or thyroid disease. Treatment consists of drugs that increase acetylcholine release by depolarizing synaptic membranes (pyridostigmine), plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive agents, similar to myasthenia gravis."
