    "explanation": "\nSclerodactyly and Raynauds phenomenon are seen in scleroderma (not scleredema).\nThe symptoms of scleredema are due to a thickened dermis, deposition of mucin, and replacement of subcutaneous fat with coarse collagen fibers.\nThe dermis is 3\u20134 times thicker than normal due to an increase of type 1 collagen synthesis by dysfunctional fibroblast. However, fibroblast proliferation is not seen. Erythema and a peau d\u2019orange appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristically spared.\nDiabetic scleredema is the most common type. Here, the accumulation of collagen may be due to irreversible non\u25a0enzymatic glycosylation of collagen and resistance to degradation by collagenase. It can also occur post-streptococcal infections.\nThe image shows scleredema in a diabetic patient with firm non\u25a0pitting edema and induration on the upper back, neck, and shoulders on an erythematous background.\n [Image Reference: Dermatology_img_3.jpeg, Dermatology_img_75.jpeg, Dermatology_img_804.jpeg]"

    "explanation": "\nThe finding seen in the case scenario provided is seborrheic keratosis and this is highly suggestive of visceral malignancy.\nA sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses in association with skin tags and acanthosis nigricans has been associated with a variety of malignancies, including gastrointestinal and lung cancers; it is also known as the Leser-Tr\u00e9lat sign.\nSeborrheic keratoses are common epidermal tumors consisting of a benign proliferation of immature keratinocytes. They present as well-demarcated, round or oval lesions with a dull, verrucous surface and a typical stuck-on appearance."

    "explanation": "\nThe above image shows Medlar bodies that are suggestive of chromoblastomycosis.\nMedlar bodies are golden-brown, thick\u25a0walled muriform or sclerotic cells in abscesses. They may also be found within giant cells.\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue which is caused by pigmented fungi (Phialophora and Fonsecaea species). The lesions start as warty papules, slowly enlarge to form a hypertrophic plaque progressing to large hyperkeratotic masses over months to years. Satellite lesions are produced by scratching."
