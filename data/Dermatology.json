The pus is usually sterile. Sudden withdrawal of systemic steroids is usually the trigger for this condition.\nPustular psoriasis can be divided into:\nLocalized pustular psoriasi\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis:\nAcute generalized pustular psoriasis (Von Zumbusch)\nSubacute annular and circinate pustular psoriasi\nAcute generalized pustular psoriasis of pregnancy (Impetigo herpetiformis)\nTreatment: Acitretin (oral retinoid) is the drug of choice for pustular psoriasis. However, it is contraindicated in pregnancy. Systemic steroids are used instead. Cyclosporine is the second-line drug.\n\nNote: Systemic steroids are never used for the treatment of psoriasis except in the case of Impetigo herpetiformis where they are first-line agents.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 14:\n\nA 9-year-old boy developed skin lesions on his trunk and proximal portion of his arms, 10 days after he recovered from an episode of pharyngitis. Which of the following statements are correct about this condition?\n\n\n\n2, 3\n2 and 5\n3, 4, and 5\n1 and 4\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe clinical stem of small, red, drop-like lesions on the trunk and arms (shown in the image) after an attack of pharyngitis is suggestive of guttate psoriasis.\nGuttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis occurring as a sudden onset shower of small lesions seen diffusely over the body, more on the trunk and proximal limbs. It is more common in children and young adults, following infection with group A streptococcus and is often the first presentation of psoriasis. It can also occur as a flare-up in adults with plaque psoriasis that began in childhood. It is linked to HLA\u25a0C:06:02.\nLesions usually resolve over about 3 months. Some patients with acute guttate psoriasis might develop plaque psoriasis in the future.\nTreatment:\nTopical steroid\nAntimicrobials - Recurrent episodes may be related to the pharyngeal carriage of the responsible treptococcus by the patient or close contact. A course of semisynthetic penicillin with rifampin may be required to clear chronic streptococcal carriage.\nPhototherapy - Broad-band ultraviolet B (UVB)- Response is better with broadband UVB over narrow-band UVB.\nA chronic course is seen in plaque and follicular psoriasis.\nPustular psoriasis patients can have a fever, erythroderma, hypocalcemia, and cachexia.\n\n\n",

In\u25a0patients are treated with a coal tar bath, suberythemogenic UVB and then dithranol in Lassar\u2019s paste is applied to plaques.\nThe mechanism of action of dithranol may relate to its antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on keratinocytes. Dithranol produces brown staining of the skin, which resolves about 2 weeks after therapy is completed.\nBoth regimens have a good safety profile and are highly efficacious.\n\n\n",

Desmoglein 3 is also involved in pemphigus vegetans.\nPatients with pemphigus foliaceus, who have anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies alone, exhibit skin blistering without mucosal involvement.\nEpidermolysis bullosa simplex is associated with congenital defects in K5/K14 antigens. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa is associated with congenital defects in laminin.\n\n",

It causes blistering, particularly in the intertriginous areas.\nOn histology, there is a widespread loss of cohesion between suprabasal keratinocytes leading\nto acantholysis, which is incomplete. Hence, separated keratinocytes are still partially connected to each other giving the appearance of a dilapidated or broken brick wall, as shown in the following image.\n\n\n\n\n",

They are commonly seen in the borderline spectrum but are most severe in borderline lepromatous leprosy.\n\nLepra 1 reactions are due to an enhanced cell-mediated immune response to M.leprae.\nThey usually present abruptly with redness and inflammation of existing lesions but can cause ulceration in severe cases. It occurs due to a large amount of M. leprae antigens in these patients which results in prolonged and repeated reactions during treatment.\nNote: Another form of lepra reaction with ulcerating lesions is the Lucio reaction. It is a rare type of lepra reaction that is seen in patients with lepra bonita. It is often the initial presentation in untreated patients. It is common over extremities and spreads in an ascending fashion. It presents as tender nodules that form jagged ulcers.\n\n\n",

However, it is generally avoided in women due to its devastating teratogenic side effects. It may be considered in severe ENL but must be used cautiously, with double contraception measures. It also causes peripheral neuropathy and, hence, would be avoided in this patient with lepromatous neuropathy.

The likely drug used in this immunosuppressed young woman is clofazimine, which causes deposition of crystals in the intestinal mucosa, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen, not renal tubules.\nClofazimine is a brick red, fat\u25a0soluble crystalline dye with a weak bactericidal action against M. leprae through an unknown mechanism. It also has an anti\u25a0inflammatory effect, which is useful in the management of ENL reactions.\n\nThe most noticeable side effect is skin discoloration, ranging from red to purple-black, the degree of discoloration depends on the dose and amount of leprous infiltration. It generally fades within 6\u201312 months after stopping clofazimine, however, traces of discoloration may remain even for up to 4 years. Urine, sputum, and sweat may turn pink.\nIt also produces scaling and ichthyosis of the shin and forearms.\nCrystal deposition in the wall of the small bowel occurs as the drug is excreted into the bile. This causes GI side effects that range from mild cramps to diarrhea and weight loss.\nNote: Corticosteroids are the first-line drugs in the treatment of ENL but would be avoided in this immunosuppressed patient.\n\n\n",

Exfoliative toxin (ETA and ETB) is produced by the cocci which targets the cell adhesion protein desmoglein 1 (DG1) resulting in the separation of intraepidermal keratinocytes.\nA widespread erythematous eruption is seen more in flexures leading to blister formation (Nikolsky positive) and ultimately painful raw areas. Dislodgement of the intact superficial epidermis by a shearing force, indicating a plane of cleavage is called the Nikolsky sign.\nChildren (&lt;6 years) and neonates are most commonly affected by the generalized form of SSSS, rarely adults may be affected. In children, SSSS is known as Ritter disease. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome usually settles within a few weeks when treated with appropriate systemic antibiotics.\n\n\n",

Regional lymphadenitis is rare in bullous impetigo.\nImpetigo is a contagious, superficial pyogenic infection of the skin. The face, especially around the nose, mouth, and limbs, is most commonly affected, but lesions may occur anywhere.\nSuperficial intraepidermal bullae are formed as desmoglein-1 is targetted by the exfoliative toxins produced by S. aureus. After the bullae rupture, they leave behind varnish crust. Central healing and peripheral extension may give rise to circinate lesions which are eroded.\nTreatment involves topical fucidin or mupirocin, retapamulin in resistant cases. Systemically therapy with flucloxacillin and erythromycin may be given.\n\n\n",

The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved in shingles.\nHerpes zoster/shingles is an acute cutaneous segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential before zoster can occur.\nThe first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. Occasionally, the pain may not be followed by the eruption (\u2018zoster sine eruptione\u2019). The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx.\nThe most commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic &gt; cervical &gt; trigeminal &gt; lumbosacral. The incidence of ophthalmic zoster increase with age. The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes.\nHerpes zoster ophthalmicus is a variant of zoster involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). Herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome is another variant involving the geniculate ganglion and presents with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, otalgia and vesicles over external ear.\nZoster is a self-limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and post-herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild infections.\nIndications for antivirals in VZV (Acyclovir 800 mg):\nPainful zoster infections in adults\nFacial zoster at any age\nImmunocompromised\n\n\n",

It\nis generally defined as persistence or recurrence of pain more than 1-3 months after the onset of zoster. The pain may be a continuous burning pain with hyperaesthesia or a spasmodic shooting type or pruritic paraesthesia may also occur. Allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuous stimuli) is often the most distressing symptom and occurs in most people with post\u25a0herpetic neuralgia.\nA tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline is useful for hyperaesthesia and constant burning pain.\n\n\n",

Clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.\nThe clinical variants of tinea capitis are:\nEndothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.\nEctothrix -a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are een. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix infection.\nKerion -a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes.\n\n\n\nFavus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup\u25a0shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles.

Diascopy usually reveals 'apple jelly nodules'.\nNote: 'Apple jelly nodules' on diascopy are seen in both cutaneous leishmaniasis and lupus vulgaris. The skin lesion in cutaneous leishmaniasis shows central crusting, whereas in lupus vulgaris it shows central scarring.\n\nThe image shows apple jelly nodule seen on diascopy.\n\n\n\n\nThe case scenario suggests a diagnosis of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. The drug of choice for this condition is miltefosine.\nApproach to the case:\nThe patient hails from a kala-azar endemic zone\u2014Bihar. The rash appears 1-2 years after a history of prolonged fever, which suggests visceral leishmaniasis. There are 2 other differentials\u2014leprosy and tinea versicolor.\nThe presence of hypopigmented macules over the trunk and face, suggests a differential of leprosy, but the nerves and sensations are normal, hence ruling it out.\nThere is no scaling visible in the lesions, ruling out tinea versicolor.\nIn kala-azar, after a variable period of years or months, diffuse nodulation begins to develop in these macules. The rash is progressive over many years and seldom heals spontaneously. As it may persist for up to 20 years, these patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection.\nThe image below shows post-kala-azar cutaneous leishmaniasis.\n\n\n\nArthropod and Parasitic Infections\n\n",

The scaly patch on the left was caused by the scratching and it marks the mite's entry point into the skin. The mite has burrowed to the top-right, where it can be seen as a dark spot at the end. Burrow is the characteristic lesion of scabies.\nScabies is an ectoparasitic infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis.\nThe characteristic symptoms include intense itching and superficial burrows. In most people, the trails of the burrowing mites appear brownish linear or s-shaped tracks in the skin and occur as a result of excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis. These are found in the webspaces, feet, ventral wrists, elbows, back, breasts, buttocks, and external genitals.\nLarva currens and cutaneous larva migrans presents as pruritic erythematous papule at the site of penetration of the hookworms with an erythematous serpiginous larva track.\nPediculosis lesions present as erythematous papules with maculae cerulae.\n\n\n\n",

It is caused by Treponema pallidum.\n\n\nTreponema is a corkscrew organism. The coils are very close and regular with around 7 to 8 coils per diameter of a red blood corpuscle. It contains a flagellum and its graceful movements are pathognomonic. It rotates along its long axis and appears to screw slowly forwards and backwards.\nOption A: Listeria is a rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nOption C: Helicobacter pylori is spiral or rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium. It\u25a0\u25a0 has two to seven unipolar flagella. It is smaller than spirochetes.\nOption D: Leptospira is also spiral and highly motile. They can be distinguished from other spirochetes by their unique question mark hook at the end of the bacterium. It is more tightly wound than Treponema with 18 or more coils per cell.\n\n\n",

It is not associated with syphilis.\nIt refers to perihepatitis that occurs as a complication of PID, due to:\nGonorrhea\nChlamydia\nMixed infections\nGenital tuberculosis.\nIt results in fever, right upper quadrant pain, and tenderness mimicking acute cholecystitis. Fibrinous violin string adhesions can be seen on laparoscopy. It is also associated with extensive tubal scarring and adhesions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA febrile reaction occurring within 24 hours of penicillin therapy for syphilis is suggestive of Jarisch-Herxheimer's reaction. Corticosteroids are only indicated in pregnant women and patients with neurosyphilis in whom the reaction can be more serious and life\u25a0threatening sequelae.\nJarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction is self-limiting and is due to lipoprotein release from the dying treponemes, which trigger cytokine release.\nThe patient presents with flu-like symptoms and exacerbation of skin lesions.

It is Secondary Syphilis that causes non-scarring alopecia that appear as moth-eaten patches if left untreated\nThe incubation period of syphilis is 9-90 days and varies inversely with the size of the Spirochaete inoculum.\nPrimary chancre: Painless, indurated, button-like ulcer with painless lymphadenopathy.\nSecondary syphilis: Roseolar rash is the earliest sign, but it is hard to see in dark-skinned people. When it fades, it leaves depigmented spots. This is called the necklace of Venus as it commonly occurs around the neck. Generalized papular lesions also occur. Sometimes these papules form a line along the hair margin called Corona Veneris or crown of Venus.\nIn latent syphilis, there are no features of active disease, but serological tests are positive. It can last up to 20 years.\nTertiary syphilis: Begins with skin nodules or the characteristic gumma which occurs 3-10 years after infection.

It is seen in the stage of secondary syphilis.\nSyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum. It is usually acquired through sexual contact and co-exists with other sexually transmitted diseases except for congenital syphilis.\nPrimary syphilis commonly presents as a papule on external genitalia that rapidly ulcerates to form a primary chancre.\nSecondary syphilis is the stage when generalized manifestations of syphilis appear on the skin and mucous membranes. Serological tests in immunocompetent patients are always positive.\nTertiary syphilis commonly presents as superficial or nodular punched out ulcers or gummas(granulomas appearing as cutaneous plaques or nodules with central ulceration)\nLate syphilis is the stage when there are no clinical stigmata of active disease but serological testing for the disease is positive\nClinical features:\nPrimary genital sores appear 3 weeks after exposure\nEnlarged inguinal lymph nodes are palpable 5 weeks after exposure\nMacular rash appears 8 weeks after exposure\nCondylomata appears 6 months after exposure\nSerological testing is done using a standard non-treponemal antibody test (VDRL, RPR) and a specific treponemal antibody test(TPHA, FTA-ABS).\n\nMicroscopically, Treponema pallidum is identified with a characteristic wave-like appearance on darkfield microscopy.\nParenteral penicillin G is the drug of choice for all stages of syphilis.\nIf the patient has a history of drug allergies, it is advisable to keep the patient under observation for 15 to 20 mins after injection. An emergency kit for the management of anaphylaxis should always be available.\nTreatment of recent sexual contacts is recommended.\n\n\n",

The classical ulcer is single, shallow, non-indurated, and may be painful or painless. The common site is the coronal sulcus in men and the posterior vaginal wall in women. It heals without scarring.\nSecondary stage: Develops 2-6 weeks later and presents as tender femoral and/ or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The nodes may coalesce to form buboes or abscesses, which later rupture to form fistulae and sinus tracts.\n\nTertiary stage: Occurs several years later and is characterized by lymphatic obstruction and disfiguring conditions such as elephantiasis and esthiomene.\nOption A: Chancroid presents with multiple painful ulcers with painful lymphadenopathy.

It is a late complication of lymphogranuloma venereum, penile tuberculosis, and primary lymphedema. It does not occur in donovanosis.\nIt occurs as a complication of long-standing inflammation, which causes fibrosis of lymphatics and connective tissue. The dorsal surface of the penis has a poor blood supply compared to the ventral surface and undergoes more fibrosis. This leads to a dorsal bend of the penis.\nGonococcal urethritis can lead to periurethral abscesses, which result in urethral strictures. In males, this may cause a saxophone penis deformity.\n\nAcidic pH is not a feature of the Amsel criteria, which are used for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.\n3 out of 4 of the following criteria are needed for a positive diagnosis:\nHomogeneous, thin, grayish-white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls.\nVaginal pH &gt; 4.5.\nPositive whiff-amine test - Fishy odor when a drop of 10% KOH is added to vaginal discharge.\nClue cells on saline wet mount: Vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent coccobacilli at the edge of the cell.\n\n\nBacterial vaginosis is caused by a reduction in lactobacilli, and an increase in anaerobic organisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Prevotella species.\nNugent scoring system is highly sensitive and is considered the gold standard for bacterial vaginosis. It is calculated using Gram-stained smear findings and observing the number of lactobacilli and morphology of anaerobes.

It is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.\nThe incubation period is 3-10 days. The primary lesion begins as a painful papule that undergoes central necrosis to form painful, non-indurated ulcers with undermined edges. Kissing ulcers due to autoinoculation may also be present.\nIt is associated with painful lymphadenopathy, which later progresses to form suppurating buboes and sinuses.\nOption B: HSV-2 infection presents with multiple vesicles, which develop into shallow ulcers, along with painful lymphadenopathy.\nOption C: LGV presents with a painless or painful ulcer later followed by painful lymphadenopathy. The incubation period is 3-30 days.\nOption D: Granuloma inguinale or donovanosis presents with a painless papule that forms a beefy red ulcer with no lymphadenopathy. The incubation period is 8-80 days (average 50 days).\n\n\n",

The lack of Wnt signaling promotes the neural fate of the neuroectoderm cells.\nA single layer of neuroectoderm forms the nervous system or the skin epithelium depending on the molecular signals it receives. Activation of Wnt signaling blocks the response of ectoderm to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the cells express bone morphogenetic proteins\n(BMPs). This leads to the epidermal fate of the neuroectoderm.\n\n\n\n\n",

It is due to mutations of the ABCA12 gene. The gene plays a role in lamellar body formation in the stratum granulosum and desquamation of the stratum corneum.\nIt presents in the neonatal period with armor\u25a0like skin (truncal plates with fissuring). It can impair body movement and breathing. Bilateral ectropion and eclabium are present. Respiratory problems are the major cause of death due to alveolar collapse in neonates. They are also prone to skin and lung infections.\nDefective lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum seen in electron microscopy are pathognomic of Harlequin ichthyosis. In early life, constant supportive care is required. Treatment includes moisturizing cream, antibiotics, etretinate, or retinoids.\nOther options -\nOption A) Ichthyosis vulgaris - The most common type of ichthyosis, involving mutations in filaggrin protein. Filaggrin is an epidermal protein that helps retain moisture in the stratum corneum. Ichthyosis is not present at birth but develops during the first months of life. The scaling usually involves the extensor surfaces of the extremities with flexural sparing. They are strongly correlated with atopic dermatitis and other forms of atopy such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, etc.\nOption B) Bathing suit ichthyosis is a type of congenital ichthyosis caused by mutations in the TGM1 gene. It presents as a collodion baby at birth where the neonate is encased in a shiny parchment\u25a0like membrane. Shedding of the collodion membrane is followed by the development of large dark grey/brownish scales affecting the trunk and the scalp, but sparing the face and extremities resembling a bathing suit. The disease tends to become worse in the summer months and improves in winter.\n\nOption D) Lamellar ichthyosis is also a congenital ichthyosis, involving mutations in the TGM1 gene. It is characterized by large plate\u25a0like dark\u25a0brown hyperkeratoses covering the entire body with mild palmoplantar involvement. The extreme spectrum of lamellar ichthyosis is congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE) which is similar to erythroderma seen in psoriasis.\n\n\n",

Mat-like telangiectases on the face and upper trunk and limbs,\n\nand cutaneous calcinosis, most often on the fingers over joints and at pressure points, develop in the later stages, particularly in the limited systemic form of systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome.\nImage A is a classical fish mouth appearance (microstomia). Image B shows the nucleolar pattern of IF(some spots of fluorescence within the nucleus and it represents antibodies to RNA). This is seen in systemic sclerosis.\nThe majority of cases are adult-onset with Raynaud's phenomenon as the first symptom.\nThe earliest cutaneous manifestations are non\u25a0pitting edema and puffiness, which tend to be seen first in the fingers, hands, and face. The skin becomes taut, indurated, thickened, and then fixed to deeper structures on the fingers resulting in sclerodactyly.\nPruritus is described in 40% of patients and may be intense during the early or active stages of the disease. It correlates with the extent of skin sclerosis and gastrointestinal symptoms.\nAnti-scl-70 positivity in this disease is useful in predicting those at higher risk for interstitial lung disease.

The image shows giant capillaries, hemorrhages, and reducing capillary density suggesting an active pattern in systemic sclerosis.\nThe most important tests for systemic sclerosis are ANA reactivity and nail fold capillaroscopy. Investigations to exclude or confirm other autoimmune rheumatic diseases including arthritis or other forms of connective tissue disease are also done.\nNail-fold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive, easy, and safe diagnostic technique designed to evaluate the general architecture of capillary rows and fine details of small vessels of the microcirculation in the nail fold.\nThe most important indications for performing capillaroscopy include differential diagnosis of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, as well as the assessment of scleroderma spectrum disorders.\nIn systemic sclerosis, capillary abnormalities appear and evolve in a clearly defined sequence called the scleroderma pattern, which correlates with internal organ involvement.\nNail fold capillaroscopy is also listed as a systemic sclerosis classification criterion recognized by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).\n",

The clinical appearance is due to the presence of epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis.\nLupus pernio is usually painless and, as it does not tend to ulcerate, is not as mutilating as lupus vulgaris.In more than half of cases, lupus pernio is associated with sarcoidosis of the upper respiratory tract, especially in patients with involvement of the nasal rims.\nIt is also frequently associated with pulmonary fibrosis, chronic uveitis, and bony cysts, particularly affecting the terminal phalanges.\n\n\n",

The characteristic triad association of erythema nodosum with bilateral hilar and right paratracheal adenopathies, with or without pulmonary infiltrates, and polyarthritis is known as L\u00f6fgren syndrome. (it is a type of acute sarcoidosis).\nArthritis in sarcoidosis is usually symmetrical; the ankles (&gt;90% cases), knees, small joints of the hands or feet, wrists, and elbows are involved.\nErythema nodosum is the most common non\u25a0specific lesion of sarcoidosis and the first manifestation of the disease but may not be present in all patients. It may be accompanied by fever, polyarthralgia, and uveitis.\nInflammatory markers are elevated in &gt;80% of patients with acute sarcoid polyarthritis. Serum ACE level is usually increased, and rheumatoid factor is negative.\nIt usually resolves spontaneously. Some require treatment is with oral corticosteroids. The prognosis is very good.\nOption A: Heerfordt Syndrome is a rare presentation of sarcoidosis and is characterized by the presence of parotid gland enlargement, facial palsy, anterior uveitis, and fever.\nOption B: Tuberculosis generally does not show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.\nOption D: Rheumatoid arthritis also presents with polyarthralgia and erythema nodosum. Rheumatoid factor is often positive without chest involvement.\n",

It is an autoinflammatory disease (excessive response to an internal antigen) due to neutrophil dysfunction and hence antibiotics have no role in its management.\nIt commonly presents on the anterior aspect of the lower limbs. The disease starts as a papule/pustule/bulla and rapidly progresses to an ulcerative lesion. The undermined edges of the ulcer show neutrophilic infiltration. Deep ulcers heal with a characteristic cribriform or criss-cross pattern of scarring.\nThe pustular form of PG is associated mainly with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis\n&gt; Crohn's disease), the bullous form with hematological malignancies.\nPathergy is the phenomenon whereby skin trauma provokes lesions at the site of injury.

However, fibroblast proliferation is not seen. Erythema and a peau d\u2019orange appearance of the skin are commonly observed. The hands and feet are characteristically spared.\nDiabetic scleredema is the most common type.

This clinical presentation in a diabetic patient is indicative of necrobiosis lipoidica.\nNecrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum is a rare chronic and granulomatous skin disorder that affects only 0.3% of diabetic patients. The average age of onset is 30 years, with females being affected more commonly. Its postulated etiology is microangiopathy.\nMost rashes are located on the legs, especially above the tibiae. It may present as red papules that enlarge to form patches or plaques with an atrophic yellowish-brown and slightly depressed center.The lesions may resolve spontaneously or become persistent chronic lesions, that can ulcerate.\nOption A: Granuloma annular is most commonly found in children and females &lt;30 years. It manifests as groups of 1-2mm papules that range from skin colored to violaceous, in an annular arrangement over distal extremities. There is no confirmed association with diabetes.\n\n\nOption C: Reactive perforating collagenosis (folliculitis) has been reported in patients with diabetes. It is attributed to collagen glycation.\nOption D: Rubeosis is a peculiar rosy reddening of the face, and sometimes hands and feet. In longstanding diabetes, it is attributed to microangiopathy or decreased vascular tone.\n\n\n",

The parasite is acquired from direct skin contact with soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. It is common following travel to endemic or tropical areas and symptoms develop within the first 2 weeks.\nThe site of entry is marked by an inflamed papule, often located between the toes. Serpentine or linear single-track lines later appear as the larvae migrate through the epidermis. The lesions can enlarge as much as 1 to 2 cm per day.\nThe first-line treatment is oral ivermectin at 200 \uf06dg/kg. Oral albendazole is an alternative treatment.\nNote: Larva currens is caused by the migrating larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. It also produces serpiginous lesions and can be differentiated by the faster rate of progression and haphazard distribution of lesions.\nThe image below shows serpiginous larval tracks over the skin.\n\n\n\n",

As the normal function of melanin is to absorb light, the vitiligo-affected patches cannot block the light emitted from deeper layers of the skin. They appear as bluish, milky, or ivory white patches with sharp margins. Woods lamp is hence helpful in the diagnosis of vitiligo, especially in fair-skinned people in whom lesions may not be obvious to the naked eye.\nThe following image shows milky-white fluorescence under a Wood's lamp.\n\n",

Hence, you would expect to see excoriations or scratch marks.\nThe pruritis occurring in obstructive jaundice is due to cholestasis. The bile salts deposit in the skin, causing saponification of the fat surrounding the nerve endings. This leaves the nerves exposed, producing the sensation of a severe itch.\nIt involves loss of skin substance till the level of the epidermis or upper dermis.

Patients also develop telangiectasia later. They also have a tendency for developing rapid flushing due to temperature change. Rosacea is more common in women of age 30-50 years.\nThe innate immune response in rosacea appears to be altered. There is increased Toll\u25a0like receptor 2 (TLR2) activity and increased protease activity.\nDemodex mite proliferation in the pilosebaceous follicles of the face has also been suggested as a possible aetiological factor in cutaneous and ocular inflammation.

It is mostly seen in adolescent girls.\nOther psychiatric disorders associated with acne are:\nBody dysmorphic disorder - Some patients have acne as their prime symptom. The perceived acne is out of proportion to physical signs.\nEating disorders - reported in anorexia nervosa. Acne itself may be a predisposing factor for anorexia in vulnerable teenaged age groups who adopt a diet in an attempt to control their acne.\nOption B: Acne fulminans or acne maligna is a rare and severe destructive form of acne presenting primarily in adolescent males. It most frequently affects the trunk but can affect the face and presents acutely in association with systemic symptoms.\nOptions C: Acne conglobata represents a rare and severe form of acne characterized by multiple and extensive inflammatory papules, tender nodules, and abscesses which commonly coalesce to form malodorous draining sinus tracts.\nOption D: Acne mechanica describes acne that occurs at the site of repeated mechanical trauma and/or frictional obstruction of the pilosebaceous outlet resulting in comedo formation. Examples include \u2018fiddler\u2019s neck\u2019, which may occur on the neck of violin players, and is characterized by well\u25a0defined plaques with the presence of comedones, lichenification, and pigmentation\n\n\n",

Deep chemical peels cannot be used in dark-skinned patients. Even medium-depth peels need to be used with extreme caution.\nChemical peels are believed to promote desquamation which reduces corneocyte cohesion and keratinocyte plugging, so enabling the extrusion of inflammatory contents. Light chemical peels are used with the aim of helping to remove comedones as well as superficial scarring and hyperpigmentation.\nOther peeling agents are:\nPyruvic acid\nLactic acid\nMaleic acid\nCitric acid\n\nTartaric acid\nMandelic acid\nJessener's Solution - lactic acid + salicyclic acid + resorcino\n\n\n",

It is not a neoplasm.\nIt presents as a pink, lobulated mass over the nose with superficial vascular dilation. It mostly affects men past middle age. Patients seek advice because of the distorted appearance of the enlarged nose, or obstruction in breathing and vision.\nRhinophyma may be diagnosed clinically, but a skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. On histology, rhinophyma shows sebaceous gland hypertrophy, hyperplasia and fibrosis.\nThe most common indication for treatment is cosmetic. Ablation using CO2 laser or surgical resection of excess tissue with remodelling of nose can be performed.\n\n\n",

It is usually of apocrine origin and seen in the axilla, areola of the nipple, or face.\nFox-Fordyce disease or apocrine miliaria- obliteration of the apocrine duct at the infundibulum.\n\nThe given image shows hidradenitis supurativa or inverse acne. Surgical excision is the best treatment that offers a cure.\nHidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, debilitating, follicular disease that usually presents after puberty.\nThere are painful, deep\u25a0seated inflamed lesions in the apocrine gland\u25a0bearing areas of the body, most commonly the axillary, inguinal, and anogenital regions.\nThis definition is based on the San Francisco modification of the Dessau criteria. The following three criteria must be met for the diagnosis to be made:\nTypical lesions - deep\u25a0seated, painful nodules or \u2018blind boils\u2019; abscesses, draining sinuses, bridged scars, and paired or multiheaded open pseudocomedones in secondary lesions.\nTypical topography - axillae, groin, perineal and perianal region, buttocks and infra\u25a0 and intermammary folds.\nChronicity and recurrence of lesions.\nMore common in young women of ages 20-29 years. Obesity and smoking are the two main factors associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.\nTreatment includes:\nAntibiotics - tetracycline, clindamycin\nIntralesional corticosteroids\nImmunosuppressants\nAcitretin\nAnti-TNF alpha therapy\nSurgery\n\nDisorders of Hair and Nails\n\n",

This is characteristic of tinea capitis.\nThough the diagnosis is clinical, a KOH mount is used for confirmation.\nScrapings from the edge of a lesion are transferred to a slide, to which KOH is added. It is then examined under the microscope for the presence of hyphae, as shown below.\n\n\nTinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. Clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation.\nThe clinical variants of tinea capitis are:\nEndothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum.\n\n\n\nEctothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix infection.\nKerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation.

It can be identified by the presence of angulated roots.\nCatagen:\n\nAt the end of anagen, epithelial cell division slows and stops, and the follicle enters an involutionary phase known as catagen. The proximal end of the hair shaft keratinizes to form a club-shaped structure and the lower part of the follicle involutes by apoptosis. It lasts for about 3 weeks.\nTelogen:\nIt is the resting phase between catagen and the next anagen. Clubbing becomes more prominent. It lasts for about 3 months. Club hair is eventually shed through an active process called exogen.\nIn the human scalp, hair follicles may remain in a state of latency, also known as kenogen, for a prolonged period after the club hair is shed.\n\n\n",

What is the cause?\n\n\nKlebsiella infection\n\nMinocycline intake\nOnychomycosis\nPseudomonas infection\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 29:\nThis patient has green nails or chloronychia, a painless condition caused by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nPseudomonas may colonize the nail following onycholysis (painless separation of the nail from bed) which occurs due to frequent wetting or wearing of gloves causing maceration and minor trauma due to long nails or manicures. The green color is due to pyoverdin and pyocyanin, produced by P. aeruginosa.\nThough it is harmless for the patients, it may spread to other immunosuppressed individuals. Hence, these patients should not work in hospitals, kitchens and other places where they are likely to spread the infection to others.\nTreatment is with fingertip bath in white vinegar, bleach, or topical gentamicin. Option A: Klebsiella colonization can cause greyish discoloration of nails.\nOption B: Minocycline is one of the most common antibiotics used by dermatologists due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It causes a bluish-grey discoloration of nails.\nOption C: Onychomycosis causes whitish-yellow discoloration and is painful in later stages.\n\n\n\nThe given clinical image of hair seen under polarising microscopy reveals tiger tail banding\n(alternating light and dark bands) characteristic of trichothiodystrophy.\nTrichothiodystrophy is an autosomal recessive condition causing defective DNA repair. It causes brittle sulfur-deficient hair, photosensitivity, ichthyosis and systemic involvement. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum (a similar condition with defective DNA repair), there is no risk of skin cancer.\nOption A: Trichorrhexis nodosa is associated with node formation and fractures. The classic appearance, shown in the image below, is known as thrust paintbrush appearance as if two paintbrushes are rubbing against each other. It is associated with trauma to the hair shaft and arginosuccinic aciduria.\n\n\n\nB- Trichorrhexis invaginata or bamboo hair is characterized by invagination of the distal hair shaft into the proximal portion. It is seen in Netherton's syndrome. It is also called golf-tee or ball and socket appearance as seen below.\n\n\nOption D: Monilethrix, seen in the image below, is characterized by beaded hair and is fragile at the constricted sites.

Finasteride selectively inhibits type 2 5\uf0b0 \u25a0reductase within the hair follicle. Hence, it is used in the treatment of male-pattern hair loss.\nThe 5\uf0b0 \u25a0reductase enzyme converts testosterone to the more potent form of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 5\uf0b0 \u25a0Reductase exists in 3 isoforms. Type 1 and 3 are widely distributed in the skin and not involved in hair growth.\n\nType 2 is present in androgen-responsive tissues such as the dermal papillae of the hair follicle, prostate, epididymides, and seminal vesicles. Type 2 5\uf0b0 \u25a0reductase also plays a key role in regulating androgen-dependent hair growth.\nHair growth in the following areas is androgen dependent:\nBeard, chest, and extremity hair in males\nScalp, pubic, and axillary hair in both sexes Male-pattern hair loss:\nMale-pattern hair loss causes thinning of the vertex and an M-shaped receding hairline, as shown below. High levels of circulating androgens stimulate hair loss in certain sites by a process called miniaturization. Finasteride reverses this process.\n\n\n\n",

Finasteride is not the first line treatment in women.\nFinasteride use in pregnancy can lead to teratogenic effects on male fetuses.\nAndrogenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by follicles and miniaturization. It is of two types , male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Male pattern hair loss may occur in female &amp; vice versa is also true. Male pattern hair loss causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex.\nMiniaturization refers to a reduction in the size of follicles until it leaves behind a remnant called stelae or streamers. Elastic staining of the stelae shows Arao-Perkin's bodies.\nDHT is a more potent form of testosterone. It is responsible for follicular regression and thus causes androgenic alopecia. Finasteride inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT and hence is used for treatment.\nMinoxidil is a potent vasodilator. It is used orally to treat severe hypertension. When used as a hair lotion, it prolongs the anagen phase and slows down or prevents hair loss. Drugs used to treat male pattern baldness:\nMinoxidil lotion\n5-alpha reductase antagonist - Finasteride Drugs used to treat female pattern baldness:\nMinoxidil lotion\nAnti-androgens - spironolactone, flutamide, and cyproterone acetate\n",

It often appears as the fever subsides and may persist for about 3-6 months.\nPCP mimics melasma and may be misdiagnosed if proper history is not taken.\nAnother close differential is fixed drug eruptions (FDE). FDE is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It is characterized by well-defined brown, hyperpigmented plaques that may follow vesiculobullous lesions. They occur on lips, hands, legs, face, genitalia, and oral mucosa, and can cause a burning sensation.They usually present 30 min to 8 h after drug exposure and recur at the same location on re-exposure.

In non-pregnant women, it is called melasma.\nChloasma is very common in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes.\nIt is due to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, stimulating the activity of melanocytes. Histopathology shows no increase in number but hyper-functional melanocytes. It resolves on its own after pregnancy.\nMelasma is the most common cause of chronic facial melanosis. It is manifested by hyperpigmented macules that become more pronounced after sun exposure. Hypermelanosis affects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and chin. It is more common in women between 20-40 years. It is frequently seen in women on oral contraceptives.\nWood's lamp examination is useful to differentiate the level of pigmentation and treatment response:\nEpidermal melasma- shows enhanced color contrast\nDermal melasma- shows less color contrast (more resistant to treatment)\nMixed melasma.\nMelasma is more chronic and requires treatment with depigmenting agents like:\nKligman's triple combination - topical hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid compound cream (first line)\nHydroquinone (reduces tyrosinase activity)\nKojic acid (tyrosinase inhibitor)\n\nChemical peels\n\n\n",

What could be the most probable diagnosis?\n\n\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis\nAtopic dermatitis\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis\nErysipelas\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe clinical scenario depicting pruritic lesions at a flexural site along with a family history of atopy (asthma) is suggestive of atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema (AE). The scratch marks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of AD.\nAD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules, papules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesions later become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skin\nand secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area) and later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood and in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures.\nThe filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and intermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier is associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due to environmental factors (detergents, hard water, UV light) or local inflammatory\nreactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading to reduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrin expression.\nOther options:\nOption A: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezzia fungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known as dandruff.\n\n\nOption C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct contact with the skin.Patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling,\npapules, and papulovesicles. Some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry), PPD/Para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. Patch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD.\n\n\nOption D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skin lesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peau d'orange or orange peel-like appearance.\n\n",

Acute spontaneous urticaria can be triggered:\nHypersensitivity\nViral infections\nFood allergy\nDrug allergy\nBlood transfusions.\nHowever, the actual cause is unknown in nearly 60% of cases.\nIt is characterized by wheals, which are evanescent, well\u25a0defined, pink, or pale swellings due to reversible dermal edema. It usually fades within hours without pigmentation. Wheals are usually very itchy and associated with a surrounding red flare when they arise.\nThey may occur anywhere on the body, including the scalp, palms, and soles, in variable numbers and sizes.\n\n\n",

It is also called angioneurotic edema or Quincke's disease. C1INH enzyme normally inhibits the following:\nComplement system\nKallikrein system\nFactor XII or Hageman factor\nIn HAE, loss of C1INH activity leads to loss of inhibition of these above processes.

NSAIDs are the most commonly implicated drug.\nFixed drug eruption (FDE) is a cutaneous adverse drug reaction characterized by recurrent well\u25a0defined lesions occurring at the same sites each time the offending drug is taken. It typically presents 30 min to 8 h after drug exposure.\nThe most common drugs that act as triggers are:\nNSAIDs (25%)\nParacetamol (15%)\nCotrimoxazole\nTetracyclines\nFDE is a form of classical delayed\u25a0type hypersensitivity reaction.\nTypically, FDE presents as a sharply defined, round, or oval erythematous and oedematous plaque, which evolves to become dusky, violaceous, and occasionally vesicular or bullous lesions. Lesions are usually solitary or few in number.\nCommonly affected sites include the lips, genitals, palms, and soles; 5% of cases may have an exclusive mucosal involvement. Overall, the most common site involved is the genitalia.\nThe majority of FDE is self\u25a0limiting with an excellent prognosis.\n\nNote: The generalized bullous form of FDE should be differentiated from toxic epidermal necrolysis by prior similar history, absence of target lesions, and no involvement of mucosal surfaces.\n\n\n",
