This study can be used to evaluate mechanical problems such as an obstruction or fistula. In suspected perforation, a single contrast with a water-soluble medium is preferred.\nThe advantages of single-contrast studies include precise control of barium column, easier identification of filling defects, and suitability for patients unable to swallow gas-forming tablets.\nDouble-contrast studies: These studies use positive and negative contrast agents to increase the sensitivity of the examination. In these studies, thick barium coats the lumen, and effervescent tablets ingested distend the lumen with air.\nPositive contrast: Barium or barium-like agents e.g., gastrografin\nNegative contrast: Air or CO2\nThe advantages of the double-contrast studies include the \"see-through\" effect, which provides enhanced visualization of mucosal details and increased sensitivity for detecting mucosal irregularities. These studies also allow for better distention and separation of the bowel loops and also better detection of small mucosal lesions, polyps, and ulcers.\nThe radiograph given below shows a double-contrast barium enema:\n\n\n\n\n",

It starts from the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner. Clinical features include abdominal pain, diarrhea (often with blood), rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and passage of mucus.\nOn barium studies, the lead pipe appearance refers to the complete loss of haustral markings in the affected section of the colon, which appears smooth-walled and cylindrical, resulting from chronic inflammation.\n\n\n",

It has shouldered margins resembling an apple core. The appearance is classically described on contrast enema studies and is almost always due to a stenosing\nannular colon carcinoma.\nColon carcinoma typically arises in patients above the age group of 50 years. It arises from the adenomatous polyps after a mutation sequence of adenoma-carcinoma influenced by environmental factors. Most colon cancers occur in the left colon. The clinical features of colon carcinoma include a change in bowel habits or rectal bleeding in cases of left-sided colon tumors and iron deficiency anemia or a mass in proximal lesions of the colon.\nColonoscopy is the investigation of choice in suspected colorectal carcinoma. Double-contrast barium enema shows a constant irregular filling defect known as the apple core appearance. Computed tomography (CT) virtual colonoscopy has replaced barium enema as it is highly sensitive. Spiral CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is now the standard means for staging colon cancer.\nThe image below shows the apple-core sign:\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What is the most probable diagnosis?\n\n\nAnal atresia\n\nHirschsprung\u2019s disease\nMeconium ileus\nToxic megacolon\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given clinical scenario and the barium enema showing a dilated right colon, with a transition zone in the mid-descending colon, are together suggestive of Hirschsprung disease.\nThe most important sign on barium enema is a sudden change of calibre from the narrow aganglionic segment and dilated proximal bowel.\nHirschsprung disease is characterized by aganglionosis (absence of ganglion cells) in the distal colon and rectum. This may occur due to the failure of neuroblasts in neural crest cells to migrate into bowel segments or the degeneration of already migrated neuroblasts. Hence, functional obstruction develops as a result of a spasm in the denervated colon.\nClinical features typically include failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation. Hirschsprung disease may present with enterocolitis, a severe complication that can be life-threatening. There is a notable association between Hirschsprung disease and Down's syndrome.\nWater-soluble contrast enema is the initial investigation and diagnostic test of choice. It shows a narrow aganglionic segment, a conical transition zone, and a dilated proximal bowel. Rectal biopsy is the gold standard investigation.\nThe image below shows dilated ganglionic and contracted aganglionic segments in Hirschsprung disease:\n\n\n\n\nA newborn presenting with respiratory distress shortly after birth, along with the chest X-ray showing bowel loops in the thoracic cavity, is suggestive of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).\n\nNormally, the pleuroperitoneal cavities separate by 8-10 weeks of gestation. CDH is due to a failure to close the pleuroperitoneal canal in the developing fetus. This malformation allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, impairing lung development and function. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia, which usually involves the left side. Mortality is predominantly due to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia.\nChest X-ray findings in congenital diaphragmatic hernia include:\nBowel loops in the thorax\nIndistinct diaphragm with opacification of part of or all the hemithorax (typically left-sided)\nDeviation of lines such as the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, umbilical arterial and venous catheters.\nGiven below is the chest radiograph of Bochdalek hernia.\n\n\nGiven below is the chest radiograph of Morgagni hernia.\n\n\nNote: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided in the management of this baby. Bag and mask ventilation may increase abdominal distension and limit the expansion of the hypoplastic lungs.\n\nHepatobiliary and Pancreatic Radiology\n",

The most common location of intussusception is ileocolic. Clinically, it presents with cramping abdominal pain, palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and passage of red currant jelly stools.\nA plain radiograph may show a meniscus sign, i.e. soft tissue mass contrasting the bowel that is air-filled. The target sign of intestinal intussusception, also known as the doughnut sign or bull's eye sign, is a diagnostic feature observed on abdominal ultrasound. This appearance is due to concentric alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands. The echogenic bands are formed by the mucosa and muscularis, and the hypoechoic bands are formed by the submucosa.\nOther ultrasound signs of intussusception include:\nPseudokidney sign - This is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel. The edematous bowel resembles renal parenchyma, and the mesentery, which is dragged into the intussusception, resembles renal hilum.\nCrescent in a doughnut sign - A hyperechoic semilunar structure caused by mesenteric fat pulled into the intussceptum.\nThe below images show USG films depicting the target sign and pseudo-kidney sign respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The more severe form of CDI is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMC).\nToxigenic Clostridium difficile produces toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin), damaging the epithelial-cell barrier function and causing diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation, which initially appear as small whitish-yellow plaques and later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. The patient also presents with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis.\nOn CT imaging, accordion sign, also referred to as concertina sign, may be seen. The terms accordion or concertina refer to a harmonica like a musical instrument. The thickened edematous bowel resembles the folds of an accordion. The hyperemic-enhancing mucosa stretched over the thickened submucosal folds produces this appearance. This is also seen when the contrast gets trapped between edematous haustral folds and pseudomembranes of the colon.\nAccordion sign is typical for pseudomembranous colitis but can be also seen in ischemic colitis, AIDS-related colitis, and severe edema from cirrhosis.\nThe CT image below depicts accordion sign:\n\n\n\n",

Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\nSigmoid volvulus\nColonic diverticulosis\nCecal volvulus\nParalytic ileus\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario of a 64-year-old man with severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and obstipation along with the radiograph showing the coffee bean sign is likely to be sigmoid volvulus.\n\nIt occurs when the sigmoid colon twists on the sigmoid mesocolon.\nA sigmoid volvulus can be differentiated from a cecal volvulus by swirl sign, location of the obstructed loop, and anatomical appendages. The apex of a sigmoid volvulus usually lies high on the left side. The apex of a caecal volvulus may lie on the right side or extend to the left upper quadrant. The swirl sign in with sigmoid volvulus is located at the level of the pelvic brim while the swirl in cecal volvulus is located in the right lower quadrant.\nOther options:\nOption C: Cecal volvulus is more common in females in the 4th to 5th decade. It is characterized by ischemia.\n\n\nOption D: Paralytic ileus occurs secondary to neuromuscular failure, leading to the failure of transmission of peristaltic waves.

What is the probable diagnosis?\n\n\nCholelithiasis\nAcute cholecystitis\nGallbladder carcinoma\nGallbladder abscess\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 1:\nA patient presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, with CT showing a Mercedes-Benz sign, is characteristic of cholelithiasis.\nMercedes\u2013Benz sign (triradiate sign), is seen when a gallstone contains central radiolucent gas. The fissures may be tri-radiate or bi-radiate (seagull sign). These fissures appear dark on CT or radiographs, giving the sign its characteristic appearance.\nGallbladder stones or cholelithiasis are the most common condition affecting the gallbladder. They are often discovered incidentally and typically remain asymptomatic. However, they become symptomatic when the stones obstruct the cystic duct. In such cases, patients may experience dull or colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with symptoms like nausea and vomiting.\nOnly about 10% of gallstones are radiopaque. Ultrasonography (USG) is the most accurate initial imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of gallbladder stones. These stones appear as echogenic foci producing acoustic shadows.

It is used to calculate the modified CT severity index.\nPlain erect chest x-ray and abdominal radiographs are not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis and can only be used to rule out certain differentials. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the imaging investigation of choice, but may not always be needed. Various scoring systems are used to grade the severity of acute pancreatitis based on blood investigations and radiographic findings.\nThe optimal time for the performance of contrast-enhanced CT imaging in cases of acute pancreatitis is more than 72 hours from the onset of symptoms. In the first 72 hours, CT may underestimate the extent of necrosis. CT scan in pancreatitis is indicated in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, organ failure, sepsis, and patients with clinical deterioration despite the treatment.\nBelow is a CT image showing an inflamed pancreas with peripancreatic inflammatory fat stranding:\n\n\n\nBelow are CT images showing extensive parenchymal calcification in pancreas:\n\n\nThe most sensitive investigation for chronic pancreatitis is EUS (endoscopic ultrasound).

Pancreatic carcinoma presents with varied symptoms, commonly including weight loss and anorexia, which may or may not be accompanied by abdominal pain. Tumours in the pancreatic head often cause early bile duct obstruction, leading to jaundice.\nFrostberg's inverted 3 sign is a sign seen on a barium examination.

The most likely diagnosis is:\n\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nMetastatic infiltrates\n\nHepatic adenoma\nHemangioma\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 15:\n\nThe image given is of hepatic adenoma. It is the most frequent hepatic tumour in young women on oral contraceptive pills.\nHepatic adenomas, also referred to as hepatocellular adenomas, are benign liver tumours. They are well-defined vascular lesions, which are generally solitary. They are almost always seen in women between the age of 25 and 50 years and are associated with the use of the oral contraceptive pill.\nOn CT, uncomplicated adenomas are usually homogeneous, with a well-defined margin. They enhance markedly and uniformly during the arterial phase and then merge with the surrounding liver during the portal phase.\nHepatic adenoma on the CT scan is shown below.\n\n\nOther options:\nOption D: On contrast-enhanced CT scan, hemangiomas show asymmetrical, nodular peripheral enhancement that is isodense with large vessels and progressive centripetal enhancement. Liver hemangioma on CT scan is shown below.\n\n\n\nOption B: Most metastatic deposits appear as areas of low attenuation on unenhanced CT and portal-phase CT. Hypervascular tumours are often visible as low-attenuation lesions on unenhanced images and may enhance transiently in the arterial phase, some becoming invisible in the portal phase. Metastatic infiltrates in the liver in the portal phase on CT scan are shown below.\n\n\nOption A: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically shows a decreased signal on T1-weighted images and a moderately increased signal on T2-weighted images, with internal heterogenecity. MRI is regarded as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting HCC. Given below is the MRI image of HCC:\n\n\n\n\n\nKehr's sign is a clinical finding seen in splenic rupture and not a radiographic finding.\nKehr's sign refers to referred pain in the tip of the left shoulder when firm pressure is applied over the left upper quadrant. This is commonly due to diaphragmatic irritation resulting from blood accumulation beneath the left diaphragm in cases of suspected splenic rupture. It is also elicited by raising the left leg.\nThe spleen is the visceral organ most commonly injured in blunt trauma abdomen. Severely ill patients may present with hypovolemic shock manifesting as tachycardia, hypotension, and pallor. A splenic rupture may not always be clinically apparent and spontaneous splenic rupture or pathological rupture can occur after minor trauma or insignificant events.\nSigns of splenic rupture on plain X-ray are obliteration of splenic outline, loss of psoas shadow, elevation of left hemidiaphragm and fracture of lower ribs on left side. The investigation of choice in blunt trauma abdomen is CECT. Splenic lacerations are linear low-attenuation parenchymal defects and are almost always associated with haemoperitoneum.\nThe image below is a CT abdomen showing splenic laceration and hematoma.\n\n\n\nThe image given below is a CECT abdomen showing a splenic laceration.\n\n\nNephroradiology\n\n",

It is usually seen as an echogenicity along the anterior wall of the right portal vein. In the above image, the arrow represents the fibrous atretic plate at the porta hepatis.\nBiliary atresia may also be termed as noncystic obliterative cholangiopathy. It is a disease of the intra and extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown etiology.\nThe classification of biliary atresia with the regions involved is as follows: Type I - Common bile duct\nType IIa - Common hepatic duct\nType IIb - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct.\nType III (most common type) - Common bile duct, hepatic duct, cystic duct; no anastomosable ducts at porta hepatis.\nClinical features include persistent jaundice, clay-colored stools, and hepatomegaly. Untreated newborns will show signs of liver cirrhosis and failure (ascites, portal hypertension, and failure to thrive).\nLaboratory evaluation will show elevated levels of direct and indirect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.

It is characterized by gall bladder wall thickening due to epithelial and smooth muscle hyperplasia along with cystic epithelial invagination into the wall, referred to as\nRokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. The most common location is in the fundus of the gall bladder and the sinuses often contain stones.\nOn USG, the characteristic findings are a thickened gallbladder wall showing bright echoes arising from the cystic spaces with \u2018comet-tail\u2019 ring-down artefacts, as seen in the image below. The comet-tail artefact is caused by the cholesterol crystals trapped within the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, causing reverberation (large number of reflected waves).\n\n\n\n\n",

Additionally, the lower poles of both the kidneys are directed medially towards the spine, as depicted in the accompanying image.\n\n\nHorseshoe kidney results from the fusion of two functional kidneys located on either side of the midline, typically connected by an isthmus composed of either functional renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue. In most cases, the fusion occurs at lower poles.\nThe ascent of the horseshoe kidney is halted by the inferior mesenteric artery, which prevents it from reaching the normal level of T12- L3. Consequently, the kidney remains lower in the abdomen, making it more susceptible to complications such as reflux, obstruction, and stone formation.\nThe following image shows horseshoe kidneys on abdominal CT:\n\n\nNote: When both upper and lower poles are fused, it is termed a discoid kidney.\n\n\n",

It is a late complication of genitourinary tuberculosis.\nTuberculous cystitis results in fibrosis and stiffening of the entire urinary bladder, leading to an inability to expand and a significant reduction in bladder capacity, as depicted in the figure. The medical term for this feature on the intravenous urogram is a thimble bladder.\nGenitourinary TB is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the bloodstream and is thus always a secondary TB. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It can affect the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vas deferens.\nLesions caused by tuberculosis in the kidney include:\n\nPapillary ulcer - earliest lesion\nPyonephrosis - caused by multiple scattered papillary ulcers undergoing caseous necrosis, which later become filled with pus\nPerinephric abscess - by extension of pyonephrosis or tuberculous renal abscess\nPseudocalculi - occurs when calcium gets deposited in a papillary ulcer healed with fibrosis\nGhost calyces - caused by the destruction of the calyces\nPutty/cement kidney - amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney\n(seen in X-ray and CT)\nUreteric lesions seen in genitourinary tuberculosis include Kerr\u2019s kink (kinking of the ureteropelvic junction), stricture, beaded ureter, and shortening of the ureter.

What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\nTuberculosis\nSchistosomiasis\nNeurogenic bladder\nBladder carcinoma\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe clinical scenario and the CT-KUB image, which demostrates circumferential calcification of the bladder wall with normal volume, are indicative of bladder schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia of the bladder. In advanced stages, there is development of a densely calcified bladder resembling a fetal skull.\nSchistosoma haematobium primarily causes genito-urinary schistosomiasis. The adult worms live in the veins of the urinary bladder. Chronic schistosomiasis presents as painless terminal hematuria, dysuria, and proteinuria. Fibrosis may cause obstructive uropathies like hydronephrosis and hydroureter.\nThe radiographic features are as follows:\n\nAcute phase - nodular bladder wall thickening\nChronic phase:\nContracted fibrotic, thick-walled bladder.\nCurvilinear calcifications due to large numbers of calcified eggs in the bladder wall.\nComplication - squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), presenting as a mass.

What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n\nThimble bladder\n\nNeurogenic bladder\nBladder carcinoma\nSchistosomiasis\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe given cystogram shows an elongated and pointed bladder with a thickened trabeculated wall, called a Christmas tree or pine cone bladder. This is seen in patients with severe neurogenic bladder and increased sphincter tone.\nNeurogenic bladder is a term applied to a dysfunctional urinary bladder that results from an injury to the central or peripheral nerves that control and regulate urination. It causes detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Neurogenic bladder typically occurs due to suprasacral lesions (above S2-S4) or apical lesions (in and around S2-S4).\nPine cone bladder is not pathognomonic of a neurogenic bladder. It may also be seen in patients with lesions anywhere along the sacral reflex arc. Occasionally, it is also seen in bladder neck obstruction of a non-neurogenic cause.\nOther options:\nOption A: Tuberculous cystitis results in fibrosis and stiffening of the entire urinary bladder, leading to an inability to expand and a significant reduction in bladder capacity, as depicted in the image below. The medical term for this feature on micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is a thimble bladder.\n\n\nOption C: In bladder carcinoma, lesions are seen on the wall of the bladder and a biopsy is taken to confirm the diagnosis.

The most common radiological sign is a filling defect seen in intravenous urography (IVU).\n\nOption D: Schistosomiasis of the bladder is a parasitic infection by Schistosoma hematobium. The radiographic features in the acute phase is nodular bladder wall thickening, and in the chronic phase, it is the contracted fibrotic, thick-walled bladder and curvilinear calcifications due to large numbers of calcified eggs in the bladder wall. On cystoscopy, it can look like nodules, pseudotubercles, ulceration, and sandy patches, and in the end stage, it can cause squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.\nThe CT-KUB image below shows circumferential calcification of the bladder wall.\n\n\n\n",

It is due to abnormal development of the right supracardinal system. A persistent right posterior cardinal vein ends up passing in front of the ureter. The anomaly always occurs on the right side, as this is the side of the normal IVC.\nOther options:\nOption B: Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a condition with a retrograde urinary flow from the bladder to the ureter and kidney. It is usually congenital. VUR can cause urinary stasis and lead to urinary tract infection (UTI).

The investigation of choice in this condition is a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or micturating cystourethrogram (MCU).\nVUR refers to an abnormal urine flow from the bladder to the ureters and occurs in young children. This reflux predisposes to pyelonephritis by allowing the entry of bacteria into the usually sterile upper tract. As such, the diagnosis is first suspected after a UTI in a very young child or recurrent UTIs. USG may reveal abnormalities like hydronephrosis and dilated ureters. VCUG must be performed in such children before the age of 6 years to look for:\nPresence and grade of VUR.\nWhether reflux occurs during micturition or bladder filling.\nPresence of associated anatomical anomalies.\nThe grading of VUR is based on the height of reflux up the ureters and the degree of dilatation of the ureters, as shown below, followed by an MCU showing grade V VUR on the left side.\n\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption B: A 99mTc-DTPA scan is used to measure GFR as it is cleared by glomerular filtration and no tubular reabsorption, determine differential renal function and evaluate for the presence of degree of renal function.\nOption C: The investigation of choice for ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a\n99mTc-Mercaptoacetyl-triglycine (MAG3) scan. 99mTc-MAG3 is the most commonly used isotope in dynamic renography. Its uptake reflects the tubular function.\nOption D: The 99mTc-DMSA scan is used for the assessment of the renal cortex as it binds to the sulfhydryl groups in proximal tubules with longer retention than other agents. It allows for a better assessment of differential renal function. It is used for the evaluation of the renal structure and morphology, detection of renal scarring in reflux nephropathy and pyelonephritis and evaluation of renal anatomical abnormalities.\n",

The investigation of choice to evaluate for renal scarring in reflux nephropathy is the Tc-99m DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan.\nIt is used in renal imaging to evaluate renal structure and morphology, particularly in paediatric imaging for the detection of scarring and pyelonephritis. DMSA is an ideal agent for the assessment of the renal cortex as it binds within the proximal tubules of the cortex with longer retention than other agents.\nIt allows a better assessment of differential renal function. It is a static scan as opposed to dynamic DTPA or MAG3 scans. Other common renal scans include:\nTc-99m DTPA (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate) - used for direct measurement of GFR as it is cleared only via glomeruli with no tubular excretion (option B).\nTc-99m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) - excreted through the renal route via both glomeruli infiltration and tubular excretion. Hence, in pediatric patients and patients with poor renal function, this test is considered superior to a DTPA scan.

This keyhole sign is seen in the presence of posterior urethral valves.\n\nPosterior urethral valves are the most common cause of severe obstructive uropathy in\nchildren. The valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit within them, which typically lie just distal to the verumontanum. They function as flap valves and are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow.\nDiagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder in the fetus, along with oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then babies typically present with urinary infections in the neonatal period or with uremia and renal failure. Clinically, a poor urinary stream, dribbling, and palpable bladder (due to diverticula) can be present.\nThe diagnosis is best made during the micturition phase of VCUG in lateral or oblique views so that the posterior urethra can be imaged adequately.

It results from a developmental abnormality due to failure of the renal mesenchyme to unite with the ureteric bud. This condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is non-functional.\nMost cases of MCDK are detected antenatally through ultrasonography. In some cases, the cysts identified prenatally may regress in utero, resulting in the affected kidney being undetectable on imaging at birth. Renal ultrasonography is the initial investigation of choice. It reveals a soap bubble appearance. Bilateral MCDK can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter syndrome.\nThe following image shows a non-visualized right kidney (red arrow).\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: In the duplicated collecting system, the drooping lily sign is seen. It refers to the inferolateral displacement of the opacified lower pole moiety due to an obstructed (and\nun-opacified) upper pole moiety.\nOption B: In polycystic kidney disease, a streaky appearance is seen due to ectatic collecting ducts.\nOption D: In renal hypoplasia, there is a congenitally small kidney with smaller calyces, lobules, and papillae but essentially normal residual parenchyma. On imaging, a hypoplastic kidney is small but otherwise normal.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 20:\n\nWhat is the investigation of choice for evaluating posterior urethral valves in a newborn male?\nMCU\nTc-DTPA scan\nUSG\nDMSA scan\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 20:\nVoiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is the best imaging technique for diagnosing posterior urethral valves.\nPosterior urethral valves result from forming a thick, valve-like membrane from a tissue of Wolffian duct origin (failure of regression of the mesonephric duct). This membrane courses obliquely from the verumontanum to the most distal portion of the prostatic urethra. They act as flap valves and are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow.\nDiagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound. However, the diagnosis is best made during the micturition phase of VCUG in lateral or oblique views so that the posterior urethra can be imaged adequately. The following findings are seen:\nDilatation and elongation of the posterior urethra - the equivalent of the ultrasonographic keyhole sign (as shown in the image below).\nLinear radiolucent band corresponding to the valve - seen occasionally.\nesicoureteral reflux (VUR) - seen in 50% of patients.\nBladder trabeculation/ diverticula.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is most commonly caused by transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter.\nTransitional cell carcinoma of the ureter can manifest as focal, eccentric, or circumferential wall thickening. On imaging, it often appears as fixed filling defects or irregular narrowing with proximal shouldering, a characteristic finding known as a goblet sign or champagne glass sign. This sign occurs due to luminal dilatation distal to the tumour, caused by the slow-growing tumor expanding the ureteral lumen. Additional features include hydronephrosis, with or without hydroureter, and, in advanced cases, absent renal function due to chronic obstruction.\n\nThis sign indicates the pathology is chronic, permitting the lesion to be accommodated in the ureter.

This is suggestive of renal angiomyolipomas.\nAngiomyolipomas (AMLs) are benign tumours that occur sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis. It is commonly seen in adults between 30 and 50 years of age, with a female predilection. AMLs predominantly affect the kidneys, though they can occur in other sites such as the liver (a common extra-renal location) and less frequently in the ovary, fallopian tube, spermatic cord, palate, and colon.\nHistologically, angiomyolipomas consist of perivascular epitheloid cells with varying proportions of vascular, immature smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. Patients with AMLs present with flank pain, a palpable mass, hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, or renal failure. Larger tumours increase the risk of complications, such as spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can manifest as sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, along with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.\nEverolimus is used for the treatment of angiomyolipomas. Treatment should be considered for asymptomatic, growing AMLs measuring &gt;3 cm in diameter. Angiomyolipomas do not normally require surgery unless life-threatening bleeding is present.\nOther options:\nRenal cyst is a broader term that includes the cystic lesions of the kidney. They can be simple cysts that are benign. Complex or complicated cystic lesions need evaluation and can be malignant. Bosniak classification is used for renal cysts. Cysts appear as hypodense lesions (greyish) with a thin wall, with or without septations.\n\nCT image showing a simple renal cyst:\n\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumour of the kidney. It usually occurs in the age group 50-70 years and macroscopic hematuria is seen in about 60% of the cases. It is a differential for angiomyolipoma but it is important to note that macroscopic fat is almost always associated with ossification or calcification.\n\n\n\n",

What is the investigation of choice?\nNon contrast CT\nDoppler\nMRI\nCECT\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 24:\nThis clinical scenario of sudden scrotal pain while playing is suspicious for testicular torsion. The investigation of choice is doppler ultrasonography. It indicates reduced or absent blood flow to the\n\ntestes.\nIn testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised due to the twisting of the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis due to a 'bell clapper deformity', resulting in ischemia of the epididymis and the testis. It is typically seen in adolescence and usually presents with sudden onset pain and swelling of the scrotum, associated with vomiting. A high-riding, swollen, and tender testis with a tender twisted cord can often be palpated above it, along with an erythematous scrotum and absent cremastric reflex on the affected side.\nA Doppler ultrasound may be taken to assess the blood supply but surgical exploration is still indicated as a clinical decision. Doppler ultrasound scanning shows absent or decreased intratesticular arterial blood flow compared to the contralateral testis. Doppler studies have improved the ultrasonographic evaluation of testicular torsion with the presence of whirlpool sign within the spermatic cord, which represents the twisted cord and is analogous to the twisted ovarian pedicle seen in ovarian torsion.\nUrgent scrotal exploration is indicated if there is doubt regarding the diagnosis. A transverse scrotal incision is taken and if the testis is viable twisting again is prevented by fixation with three non-absorbable sutures between the tunica albuginea of the testis and the scrotal raphe.\n\n\n",

The investigation of choice to assess the vascular extension of the tumor thrombus is Magnetic resonance imaging.\nRCC is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney that usually presents in the elderly. Cigarette smoking and hypertension are major associated risk factors. The classic triad of presentation is with flank pain, macroscopic haematuria, and a palpable flank mass. Advanced cases can also present with bilateral lower limb edema.\nMRI is beneficial for assessing vascular invasion, especially when evaluating the renal vein and IVC. It aids in differentiating between benign and malignant thrombus. However, it does not provide a significant advantage over CT in staging nodal disease.\nOther options:\nOption C: Triphasic contrast-enhanced CT is the investigation of choice for diagnosis and staging of RCC (image given below). On CT, small lesions enhance homogeneously, whereas larger lesions have irregular enhancement due to areas of necrosis. The CT also provides additional information on the function of the opposite kidney, primary tumor extension, venous involvement, enlargement of regional lymph nodes, the status of the adrenal glands, and intra-abdominal metastatic disease.\n\n\n\nOption A: Intravenous urography is no longer suitable for detecting renal masses, particularly if they occur centrally; cross-sectional imaging studies are more appropriate for investigating suspected renal mass.\nOption D: FDG-Positron Emission Tomography plays a limited role in the initial detection and diagnosis of RCC due to low fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by these tumours. However, it can be useful in identifying local recurrence and serves as a complementary tool alongside other cross-sectional imaging methods.\n\n\n",

What is the investigation of choice?\nUSG\nNon contrast CT\nContrast enhanced CT\nPlain X-ray KUB\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 26:\nThis clinical scenario is suggestive of renal calculi. The investigation of choice is non-contrast CT (NCCT). NCCT is useful as it has a greater sensitivity to tissue attenuation and, hence, can pick up stones that may appear radiolucent on plain X-rays.\nRenal calculi are more common in males, with 90% of stones being radiopaque. Clinically, patients present with severe pain located over the renal angle, often radiating to the groin. The pain may be accompanied by vomiting due to pyloric spasm, as well as hematuria, nausea, fever, and in some cases, symptoms of pyuria.\nA non-contrast CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for suspected urinary tract calculi. It is the most sensitive and gold-standard test for detecting stones as it is quick, detects most types of calculi, and can be performed with low radiation doses. A history of nephrolithiasis with\nnew-onset flank pain should prompt immediate evaluation with non-contrast CT. The radiographic features depend on the stone composition.\nThe following types of renal calculi may appear radiolucent on plain X-ray: Uric acid, Indinavir and pure matrix stones (may have radiodense rim or centre). On CT, most stones are usually opaque. However, indinavir and pure matrix stones appear radiolucent even on CT.\nThe following X-ray KUB image shows a staghorn calculus (struvite).\n\n\n\n\n",

What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n\nRetrocaval ureter\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis\nMedullary sponge kidney\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 27:\nThe given IVP in a patient with persistent flank pain shows the medial deviation of bilateral ureters, caused by fibrous tissue deposition in the retroperitoneum at the lumbosacral junction, resulting in the characteristic narrow-waisted maiden appearance, known as the maiden waist sign, which is seen in retroperitoneal fibrosis.\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory process of the fibro-fatty tissue in the retroperitoneum, with the idiopathic type being the most common, accounting for about 70% of the cases. Patients typically present with persistent flank pain or back pain.\nProgressive fibrotic thickening can compress the ureters, leading to bilateral hydronephrosis and, if untreated, renal failure. Aside from idiopathic causes, other causes of RPF include drug-induced factors ( e.g., methysergide, beta-blockers), advanced malignancy, radiation exposure, trauma, and chronic infections.\nDiagnosis of RPF relies primarily on imaging studies. Intravenous urography shows a characteristic triad of medial deviation of the middle one-third of the ureters, producing a maiden waist sign, hydroureteronephrosis, and extrinsic compression of the ureters by the fibrotic process. CT and MRI are also useful in radiographic evaluation of RPF.\n\n\n\nThe given intravenous pyelography (IVP) depicts the cobra head or adder head deformity or spring onion sign seen in bilateral ureterocele. These signs refer to a dilated, contrast-filled distal ureter surrounded by a thin rim of the ureteric wall and bladder mucosa.\nUreterocoele is a cystic enlargement of the intramural portion of the ureter, more commonly seen in females than males. It is thought to be caused due to ureteric orifice atresia. They are similar to ectopic ureters, which typically drain the upper pole of the kidney and are associated with\n\ndysplastic or non-functional renal tissue.\nIf they present clinically, ureteroceles often manifest with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children, while in adults, they are more likely to present with stones in the lower ureter.\nUreterocoeles can enlarge and obstruct the bladder neck or the contralateral ureteric orifice.\nThe classic sign of a ureterocele on intravenous urography is a \u2018cobra head\u2019, \u2018adder head\u2019, or\n'spring onion sign'. On ultrasonography, it can be seen as a fluid-filled cystic mass in the bladder. The treatment of simple ureteroceles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter.\n\nOBG radiology\n\n",

It occurs due to the division of the ureter as it ascends upwards from the bladder to the renal parenchyma during the embryological period of life. As a result, the affected individual may have two collecting systems for one kidney.\nDuplex collecting systems may also be complicated by vesicoureteric reflux, obstruction or ureterocoele. When the upper pole ureter is obstructed, the lower pole collecting system appears displaced and stretched on imaging, creating the \"drooping lily\" sign observed in intravenous urography.\nThe Weigert-Meyer law describes the relationship of the upper and lower renal moieties in duplicated collecting systems to their drainage. When there are abnormalities associated with duplicating collecting systems,\nThe upper pole moiety drains inferomedially and is most commonly associated with obstruction.\n\nThe lower pole moiety drains superolaterally and is most commonly associated with vesicoureteral reflux.\nThe illustration given below shows the Weigert-Meyer law.\n\n\n\n",

It predominantly affects diabetic patients who are particularly susceptible due to their hyperglycemic state, which promotes bacterial growth and fermentation. The most common causative organism is Escherichia coli, which ferments sugar to produce carbon dioxide, leading to gas accumulation within renal parenchyma or perinephric tissues. Less commonly, organisms like Klebsiella and Proteus species can also cause this condition.\nAlmost all patients present with fever, vomiting and flank pain. Patients frequently present with sepsis and ketoacidosis. If not treated early, it may lead to fulminant sepsis and is associated with high mortality.\nThe diagnosis is primarily established radiographically, with a CT scan being the investigation of choice in identifying the extent of the emphysematous process and guiding management.

It refers to the ragged, feathery calyceal outline due to irregular erosions of the calyx.\nThis appearance is due to necrotizing papillitis, which further progresses to form medullary cavities that eventually communicate with the collecting system.\nGenitourinary tuberculosis is caused by the dissemination of the organism through the bloodstream and is thus, always a secondary TB. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It can affect the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and\n\nvas deferens.\nLesions caused by tuberculosis in the kidney include:\nPapillary ulcer - earliest lesion.\nPyonephrosis - caused by multiple scattered papillary ulcers undergoing caseous necrosis, which later become filled with pus.\nPerinephric abscess - by extension of pyonephrosis or tuberculous renal abscess.\nPseudocalculi - occurs when calcium gets deposited in a papillary ulcer healed with fibrosis.\nGhost calyces - caused by the destruction of the calyces.\nPutty/cement kidney: Amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney\n(seen in X-ray and CT).\nThe illustration below shows the lesions caused by tuberculosis in the urinary tract, followed by an IVP depicting moth-eaten calyces.\n\n\n\nThe given image shows the signs of renal papillary necrosis.\n\n\n\n",

He was diagnosed with tuberculosis 10 years ago but was non-adherent to treatment. What is the most sensitive imaging modality for his current presentation?\nCT intravenous pyelogram\nBladder ultrasound\nNon contrast CT\nMRI\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nSterile pyuria in a patient with history of tuberculosis raises suspicion of renal tuberculosis. The most sensitive imaging modality for diagnosing renal tuberculosis is CT Intravenous Pyelogram.\nRenal tuberculosis occurs due to hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making it a secondary infection. There is either reinfection or reactivation of old TB. It is more common in males and typically presents with symptoms such as increased urinary frequency, polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, loin pain/suprapubic pain and sterile pyuria.\nIn sterile pyuria, urine appears pale and opalescent due to the presence of pus cells. Renal TB is a cause of sterile pyuria. Diagnosis is confirmed with a tuberculin test, or at least 3 consecutive early-morning urine specimens are examined for acid-fast bacilli. They are stained with a\nZiehl\u2013Neelsen stain and subsequently cultured.\nThe most sensitive imaging modality in renal tuberculosis is CT urography/pyelography. NCCT is the preferred means of visualizing renal calcifications. Manifestations of renal TB as seen on CT are as follows:\nEarly changes:\nPapillary necrosis (single or multiple) and uneven caliectasis\nProgressive changes:\nMultifocal strictures in any part of the collecting system\nGeneralized or focal hydronephrosis\nMural thickening and enhancement\nPoorly enhancing renal parenchyma, either due to direct involvement or due to hydronephrosis\nEnd-stage:\n\nProgressive hydronephrosis results in very thin parenchyma, mimicking multiple thin-walled cysts\nAmorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney (known as the putty kidney), as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n",

Which of the following investigations will help you confirm your diagnosis?\nHysteroscopy\nUltrasoun\nLaparoscopy\nMRI\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe given case scenario is suggestive of molar pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound, which shows a snowstorm appearance.\nMolar pregnancy is of two types:\nComplete mole appears as an echogenic uterine mass with numerous anechoic cystic spaces but without a fetus or amnionic sac. The appearance is described as a 'snowstorm' appearance. Theca lutein cysts may be seen in the ovary.\nIn partial mole, the fetus is present along with molar components.\nThe patient presents with a characteristic history of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or spotting, and vomiting during the first trimester. Also, there may be a history of passing grape-like vesicles vaginally.\nThe snowstorm appearance on USG, combined with a raised hCG and a uterus larger than the date of pregnancy, leads to the diagnosis of a complete hydatidiform mole.\n\nSuction and evacuation is the treatment of choice. Serum hCG levels are checked within 48 hours of evacuation and are used as a baseline for future comparisons. It is then checked every week until it normalizes, which usually takes 4 to 8 weeks. After the hCG values return to normal, a regular follow-up is done monthly for 6 months.\n\n\n",

What does this pattern indicate?\n\n\n\nNormal diastolic flow\nReversal of diastolic flow\nAbsent diastolic flow\nAbsent systolic flow\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given Doppler image indicates normal diastolic flow in the umbilical arteries.\nUmbilical artery vessels are characterized by forward, low-resistance flow. As gestation increases, there is a gradual fall in all the resistance indices, so the amount of forward diastolic flow increases. S/D ratio decreases as the period of gestation increases (S represents the peak systolic flow or velocity, and D indicates the end-diastolic flow or velocity).\nAbnormal flow patterns in the umbilical artery:\nReduced end-diastolic flow: Uteroplacental insufficiency.\nAbsent end-diastolic flow: Fetal compromise (terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section if gestational age is &gt;34 weeks).\nReverse end-diastolic flow: Impending doom of death (terminate pregnancy irrespective of gestational age).\n\n\nMiddle cerebral artery: This will show increased diastolic velocity in fetus with hypoxemia.\n\n\n\nThe given image shows the lemon sign, which is seen in spina bifida.\nSpina bifida is the common open neural tube defect associated with hydrocephalus and\nArnold-Chiari II malformation. It is the most common open neural tube disorder. Spina bifida is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed.\n\nThe 3 main types of spina bifida:\nSpina bifida occulta - This is the mildest form of spina bifida. The defect in the vertebral arches is covered by the skin. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it.\nMeningocele - The defect in the vertebra allows the meninges to protrude through the defect.\nMyelomeningocele (meningomyelocele) - A defect in the vertebral column allows the spinal cor with the meningeal coverings to protrude.\n\n\nThe lemon sign is related to changes in the configuration of the fetal frontal bone, which loses convexity and appears concave or linear on ultrasonography; this sign can be detected during the first six months of gestation.\nThe banana sign is another sign that is seen in spina bifida associated with Arnold-Chiari II malformation. Herniation of the brainstem and cerebellar tonsils occurs through the foramen magnum, with the cerebellum surrounding the brainstem, thus giving rise to the appearance of the curved shape of a banana.\nOther options:\nOption B: Anencephaly is characterized by an open defect in the calvaria and skin, such that the cranial neural tube is exposed. It is a severe defect and is not compatible with survival. Frog eye sign is seen in USG. Prominent orbits (arrows) and an absence of cerebral tissue more cranially are seen.\nOption C: Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the two hemispheres. On antenatal ultrasound, there may be also evidence of polyhydramnios, and the snake-under-the-skull sign may also be seen.\nOption D: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the soli abdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a sac. Given below is a fetal ultrasound image suggestive of an omphalocele (asterisk).\n\n\n\nRadiotherapy\n\n",

This sign refers to the widely spaced lateral ventricles with intervening Probst bundles(white matter tracts that are no longer able to cross the midline in the corpus callosum).\nAppearances on axial MRI or CT resemble a Formula One car seen from above. The front tyres are represented by the widely spaced frontal horns anteriorly. The back tyres are represented by the dilated trigones seen posteriorly, which is also known as colpocephaly.\nThe image given below shows the racing car sign in corpus callosal agensis.\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption B: Marchiafava - Bignami disease is a rare condition characterized by demyelination of the corpus callosum most often in patients with chronic alcoholism. The MRI image in this condition shows the sandwich sign.\n\n\n\nOption C: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease that results from a eficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared.\n\n\nOption D: The most common site of lipoma in the brain is the peri-callosal region. The CT below shows bracket calcification of lipoma and is called bracket sign.\n\n\n\n\n",

Which among the following findings confirms the diagnosis?\nFrog-eye sign\nEye of tiger sign\nBlob sign\nT Sign\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nFrog-eye sign in the ultrasound is suggestive of Anencephaly.\nAnencephaly is an open defect in the calvaria and skin that results from incomplete closure of the neural tube. It is one of the earliest detectable congenital defects that can be detected as early as 10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Screening for anencephaly reveals increased levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Diagnosis is confirmed by sonography. The following are the radiological signs seen in anencephaly:\nFrog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, causing prominent orbits, thereby resembling the face of a frog.\nShower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganize mass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap, giving rise to a characteristic triangular facial appearance.\nThe images given below show open calvaria on antenatal ultrasound and a 'shower cap' sign.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption B - Eye of tiger sign is the MRI finding seen in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive neurogenerative disorder, showing decreased T2 signal in globus pallidus an substania nigra.\n\n\n\nNote: Anencephaly, holoprosencephaly and ventral wall defects (e.g. ectopia cordis, omphalocele, bladder extrophy) have a very high rate of detection in the first trimester. The rest of the anomalies can be detected in the second trimester.\n\n\n",

Thus, the inter-twin membrane comes to an abrupt halt in a T-configuration at the edge of the amniotic sac.\nIn contrast, in a dichorionic pregnancy, the sonographic image depicts a 'twin-peak' sign or the 'lambda sign\" as the chorion is present between the intertwin membrane. A triangular portion of the placenta is seen inserted between the amniochorion layers.\nThe type of twin pregnancy is best diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasound at 11-14 weeks of gestation as the chorion and amnion are not yet fused. At 11-14 weeks, the intervening membranes are clearly visualized at the site of insertion of the amniotic membrane into the placenta.

Here, beams are modified and focused only to concentrate on the tumor and have little effect on surrounding tissue. It can be done by using:\nX-knife using a linear accelerator (LINAC)\nGamma-knife using Cobalt 60\nCyberKnife - image-guided linear accelerator using real-time image guidance to deliver radiation from multiple angles.\nThe patient wears a specialized helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull. Gamma knife aims gamma radiation through a target point in the patient\u2019s brain. An ablative dose of radiation is thereby sent through the tumour in one treatment session while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.\nSRS has been used in the treatment of almost every intracranial lesion but is commonly used in the treatment of acoustic schwannoma, pituitary adenoma, meningioma, and trigeminal neuralgia\n\nbut not glioblastoma.\nThe image below is an illustration of the principle of gamma-knife therapy:\n\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 21:\n\nPersonal monitoring of radiation is done by:\nTLD badge\nCollimators\nLinear accelerator\nGrid\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 21:\nPersonal monitoring of radiation is done by a TLD badge.\nThe TLD badge (thermoluminescent dosimeter) should be positioned according to local or national practices. In India, one TLD badge has to be worn at the chest level inside the lead apron if the apron is used. An additional wrist badge has to be worn for procedures requiring hands close to the primary beam.\nThe thermoluminescent material used is calcium sulfate doped with dysprosium or lithium fluoride. Radiation exposure is monitored every three months. The maximum dose limit for occupational radiation workers is 30 mSv in a year, provided the cumulative dose in a block of 5 years does not exceed 100 mSv.\nThe given image shows a TLD badge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the given options, the ovary is most likely to be affected as it is the most radiosensitive organ.\nRadiosensitivity of pelvic organs is as follows: ovary&gt;rectum&gt;bladder&gt;vagina. The radiation tolerance dose for the ovary is 2-3 Gy whereas the vagina is 90 Gy. Hence, among the given options, the vagina is the most radioresistant organ.\nThe radiation dose necessary to induce ovarian failure is age-dependent.

Raw: Question 5:\n\nThe Bragg peak effect is pronounced in:\nX ray\nProton\nNeutron\nElectron\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons.\nThe proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go as far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed,\n\nsuddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak.\nThe behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowing the Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, the protons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of proton therapy enables targeting tumors within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.\nThe Bragg curve shown below plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter.\n\n\n\n\n",

That is, it can be combined with CT to allow a correlation between the metabolic information (PET) and the cross-sectional anatomic information (CT).\nPET scanning measures the uptake of positron-emitting radioisotopes in the body, allowing us to visualize the functional processes of the body. 3D images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. Hence, it provides metabolic and functional\n\ninformation, unlike CT and MRI, as it is based on the principle that tumor cells generally have high metabolic activity compared with normal tissues.\nA glucose analogue called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used in PET imaging. FDG is taken up by metabolically active cells, where it undergoes phosphorylation to form FDG-6-phosphate. Unlike glucose, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further metabolism and becomes trapped within the cell and this is detected by the PET scanner.\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is another similar imaging technique. The below imaging modality is a PET CT scan.\n\nPET\nSPECT\nVery expensive\nLower cost\nUsespositron-emitting radioi sotope (tracer) like18F-FDG\nUsesgamma-emitting radiois otopes (tracer) such asTc-99 m,I-123, I-131\nBetter contrast and spatial re solution\nLess contrast and spatial reso lution\n\n\n\n",

These molecules decay in the body with the release of a positron. The positron travels a short distance and annihilates with an anti-particle (electron). This annihilation reaction results in the formation of two high-energy photons that travel in opposite directions. Each photon has an energy of 511 keV, making this a dual photon peak at 511 keV.\n",

Raw: Question 11:\n\nWhat is the technological basis of a spiral CT?\nGantry\nSlip ring\nMulti detectors\nCouc\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nSpiral CT is based on the technology called a slip ring.\nIt is a device that distributes the power supply between the patient table (or couch) and the gantry, which contains the spinning X-ray tube. The slip ring makes the simultaneous movement of the patient and X-ray tube rotation possible. The process of CT imaging is faster, and the entire trunk can be taken in a single breath-hold. Thus, there is no respiratory misregistration. Also in spiral CT, 3D reconstruction can be done.\nA spiral CT is the investigation of choice for renal stones. It is also used for staging of colon cancer and for visualization of pulmonary embolism.\nRadiation exposure:\nCT abdomen = 500 chest X-rays (highest)\nCT head = 100 to 150 chest X-rays\nMammography = 20 to 25 chest X-rays.\n\n\n",

The least cardiac motion occurs during diastole when the ventricles are passively filling. Prospective ECG triggering uses the ECG signal to control scanning so that X-rays are generated and projection data are acquired only during cardiac diastole.\nCardiac CT is done in CAD and for coronary calcium scoring. Coronary calcium scoring denotes the degree of atherosclerosis and determines prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\nIt is an example of multi-slice CT or multidetector CT (MDCT).

It allows for the differentiation of different types of tissues on the X-ray film.\n\n\n\nVery low-energy X-rays are not capable of producing the photoelectric effect. High energy X-rays are also not capable of photoelectric effect due to random scattering of electrons from the outer shell. This is known as the Compton effect and it can lead to distortion of the image.\nThe goal of X-ray imaging should be to minimize the Compton effect and maximize the photoelectric effect. The penetrating power of X-rays increases with increasing energy, which is directly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength.\n\n\n",

It acts by reducing both T1 and T2 relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since gadolinium ion is toxic, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used.\nContraindications:\nRenal failure - Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min.\n\nPregnancy - Due to the risk of teratogenicity\nGadolinium does not cross the blood-brain barrier unless the barrier is disrupted.\nOptison and Levovist are ultrasound contrast agents. Ultrasound contrast agents are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n",

Echo intensity is represented as brightness and a trace is swept across the screen so that the x-axis represents time.\nUltrasonography is a versatile imaging modality known for its portability and safety, particularly as it does not involve radiation exposure. As the safest radiological investigation for pregnancy, it provides crucial information without posing any risks to the mother or fetus, making it indispensable in obstetric care.\nDifferent modes in USG and its uses are as follows:\nA (amplitude) mode: Used in ophthalmology and orbital biometry (option A).\nB (brightness) mode: Used for all routine applications, with brightness encoded as grayscale value (option B).\nM (motion) mode: In echocardiography.\nHIFU (high-intensity focussed USG) is a therapeutic application of USG. It is useful for the treatment of fibroids. HIFU exploits the thermal effects of high-powered, tightly focused ultrasound beams so that very small target tissues can be heated and coagulated.\nThe image below depicts a duplex scan, which is a combination of B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler data acquisition.\n\n\n\nDoppler ultrasound (option D) is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld Doppler ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. A triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise and fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in diastole, and the last wave with a forward flow taking place during diastole.\nDoppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on whether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability.\nThe image below shows triphasic signal on doppler ultrasound:\n\n\n\n",

Volar-type/reverse Barton's is a fracture-dislocation of the volar rim of the radius. This type is the most common.\nDislocation of the radiocarpal joint is the hallmark of Barton's fracture. The radiographic findings are the following:\nComminuted intraarticular fracture of the distal radius\nVolar rim maintains a relationship with the carpus and both are displaced proximally\nFracture of the radial styloid process with loss of radial inclination\nReverse-type Barton's fracture is similar to Smith\u2019s fracture, but the difference is that the fracture line runs obliquely and extends into the joint surface.\nAnother type is dorsal Barton's fracture which results due to fracture-dislocation of the dorsal rim of the radius.\n\n\n\n\nThe image below shows the lateral and anterior-posterior view of the dorsal-type of Barton's fracture with dorsal displacement.\n\n\n\n\n",

It is usually done in full inspiration and standing position. Ideally, there should be no rotation. If there is no rotation the distance between the medial end of the clavicle and the spinous process will be equidistant, on both sides.

What is the diagnosis?\n\n\nPneumomediastinum\n\nPneumothorax\nPneumoperitoneum\nConsolidation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given clinical scenario and radiograph showing a spinnaker sign is suggestive of pneumomediastinum.\nSpinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates\nwith pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue\n\nupward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat.\n\n\n\nThis should be distinguished from a thymic sail sign which is a normal finding on a neonatal chest x-ray. It represents a physiologically enlarged thymus in a neonate.\nOther signs of pneumomediastinum are:\nV sign of Naclerio - It is due to a V-shaped air collection. One limb of the V is produced b mediastinal air outlining the left lower lateral mediastinal border and the other limb is produced by air between the parietal pleura and medial left hemidiaphragm.\nContinuous diaphragm sign - Normally the central portion of the diaphragm is not discretel visualised on chest radiographs as it merges with the cardiac silhouette. If the diaphragm can be seen continuously across the midline then it is suggestive of free gas within the mediastinum.\nThe image given below shows the V sign of Naclerio.\n\n\nThe image given below shows continuous diaphragm sign.\n\n\n\n",

With M-Mode, even rapid motions can be displayed, measured and recorded. In a normal lung, the M-mode image demonstrates a linear, laminar pattern in the tissue superficial to the pleural line and a granular or sandy appearance deep to the pleural line.\nThe motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates horizontal \u2018waves', and the sliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the \u2018sand\u2019.

Thoracic ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of small or occult pneumothorax in critical care patients.\nOther options:\nOption B: Pleural effusion on ultrasound appears anechoic with an echogenic line at the fluid-lung interface if it is transudate. Exudative and hemorrhagic effusions may appear echogenic with pleural thickening.

What is the likely diagnosis?\n\n\nLung abscess\nConsolidation\nPleural effusion\nPneumothorax\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 1:\nA history of fever, cough, and chest X-ray showing opacities in the right middle lobe suggest consolidation, describing a case of community-acquired pneumonia.\nClinical features include acute onset fever, cough (with or without sputum production), and shortness of breath. In some cases, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, or increased work of breathing may be present on physical examination.\nA chest X-ray can be used to diagnose pneumonia. The presence of an infiltrate on a plain chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Radiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis of CAP include lobar consolidations (along with air bronchograms within the opacity), interstitial infiltrates, and/or cavitations.\nA CT chest is used for better resolution or if the chest X-ray was non-diagnostic. Blood and sputum cultures are obtained to guide the antibiotic regimen.\nOther options:\nOption A: The radiological features of lung abscess include a thick-walled, irregular cavity containing an air-fluid level, often accompanied by surrounding pulmonary infiltrates. The cavity typically forms an acute angle with the chest wall. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than chest radiography and is used to detect small cavities that may not be visible on standard\nX-rays.\nThe accompanying X-ray image illustrates these features, showing thick-walled cavities with air-fluid levels on the lateral view:\n\n\nOption C: Pleural effusion may present with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, dry cough, and associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, oedema, and ascites depending on the aetiology. On examination, there may be tachypnea, dullness on percussion and decreased/absent breath sounds at the base(s).\nThe given X-ray image below shows left-sided pleural effusion:\n\n\nOption D: In pneumothorax, the patient will present with a history of breathlessness, and chest X-ray will show deep costophrenic angle, hyperlucency (darker area without lung markings) with inward shifting of the visceral pleural line (sharp white line).

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\nBlastomycosis\nPneumonia\nAspergilloma\nBronchiectasis\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe marked finding is known as the Monod sign, which is seen in aspergilloma. It refers to the presence of gas surrounding a fungal mass within a pulmonary cavity.\nAspergillomas (non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis): Aspergillus fumigatus can cause mass-like fungus ball formation in structurally abnormal lungs (pre-existing cavities like in pulmonary tuberculosis). On Plain film and CT, an intracavitary mass surrounded by a crescent of air (Monod sign), is typically observed, as shown below.\n\n\nAngioinvasive aspergillosis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients. On HRCT, it is characterised by ground-glass opacity surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass called a halo sign. This sign indicates a haemorrhage.\nThe below CT image depicts halo sign in invasive aspergillosis.\n\n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immune reaction. The below image depicts gloved finger appearance of ABPA in the left upper lobe. It is a characteristic sign of bronchocele.\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Blastomycosis is a chronic infection, characterized by the formation of suppurative and granulomatous lesions, especially in the lungs and skin. The pulmonary disease resembles TB or histoplasmosis. There can be focal or diffuse consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation.\nOption B: A patient presenting with fever, breathlessness, and cough with expectoration is most likely suffering from pneumonia. The CT image shows a sharply demarcated homogenous\n\nconsolidation that crosses segmental boundaries and involves only a single lobe, suggestive of lobar pneumonia.\nThe below CT scan image is highly suggestive of pneumonia in which consolidation with an air bronchogram can be seen.\n\n\nOption D: Bronchiectasis is characterized by local and irreversible dilatation of bronchi. Radiographic findings are tramline appearance (seen on chest X-rays) and ring or curvilinear opacities on end-on appearance. CT shows bronchial dilatation and lack of tapering of the bronchial lumen (cardinal sign) and signet-ring sign (internal diameter of the bronchi is greater than the adjacent pulmonary artery).\nCT image below shows thickened, dilated airways and signet-ring sign:\n\n\n\n",

A single great artery arises from the heart, due to a failure of the division of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus. Single trunk supplies both the pulmonary and systemic circulation, instead of a separate aorta and a pulmonary trunk.\nThe X-ray findings are similar to ToF. However, pulmonary plethora is seen in this condition, as opposed to pulmonary oligemia in ToF.

Tillaux\u2019s sign is seen in a mesenteric cyst.\nOption D: Stemmer's sign is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes due to skin thickening, as seen in lymphedema.\n\n\n\nA thallium scan is performed to detect reversible myocardial ischemia. It evaluates myocardial perfusion both at rest and during stress (exercise/pharmacological).\nIn reversible ischemia, a cold spot is seen during exercise or stress due to reduced perfusion, but normal perfusion is observed at rest. Conversely, irreversible infarction is indicated by cold spot during rest and stress/exercise.\nIn technetium and pyrophosphate scanning, infarct appears as a hot spot.\nMUGA (multiple gated acquisition) scan is a nuclear imaging test that can evaluate the function of the ventricles. It is used for informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure.

Which of the following best describes the underlying condition?\n\n\n\nAtrialization of the ventricle\nRight outflow tract obstruction with overriding of aorta\nAbnormal pulmonary vein drainage into systemic venous circulation\nSingle great artery for systemic and pulmonary circulation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nBased on the clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a box-shaped cardiac silhouette caused by right atrial enlargement, this is typically seen in Ebstein's anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nEbstein anomaly is characterized by an abnormal tricuspid valve that is displaced downwards into the right ventricle. Hence, a part of the right ventricle is now located above the tricuspid valve.\nThis is called atrialization of the ventricle. There can be associated tricuspid regurgitation with or without stenosis.\nray findings depend on the degree to which the tricuspid valve is displaced downwards. The features are an enlarged right atrium which causes severe right-sided cardiomegaly, giving rise to a box-shaped cardiac shadow and pulmonary oligemia.\nOther options:\nOption B: Pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aorta overriding the VSD and right ventricular hypertrophy are the defining features of Tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic congenital heart disease. X-ray findings show characteristic 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart.\nOption C: Pulmonary veins returning to the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of the left atrium, define total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation, a congenital cardiac malformation, with supracardiac variety being the most common. As a result, a large supracardiac shadow can be seen with normal cardiac shadow and gives a characteristic pattern of snowman appearance/ figure of 8 on chest X-ray.\nOption D: Failure of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus to divide into the aorta and pulmonary artery characterises truncus arteriosus, a cyanotic congenital heart anomaly. A single great artery arises from the heart, supplying both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This condition is associated with pulmonary plethora, unlike tetralogy of Fallot and is characterised by the sitting duck appearance of the heart on X-ray.\n\n\n",

Hemangioblastomas are tumours of vascular origin and occur both in patients with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease as well as sporadically.\nVon Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease characterises the development of numerous benign and malignant tumours in different organs. It is associated with a mutation in the VHL tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 3 (VHL has 3 letters: chromosome 3). They are WHO-grade I tumours that can occur in the central nervous system.\nFeatures of VHL include pheochromocytoma, CNS hemangioblastoma - cerebellar and spinal, retinal haemangioblastoma, and choroid plexus papilloma.\nOther options:\nOption A: Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous syndrome of 2 types:\nNF1 (neurofibromatosis 1) is also called as Von Recklinghausen disease.

Most common are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intracranial and spinal meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, and posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities.\nOn MRI, extracanalicular extension of vestibular schwannomas into the cerebellopontine angle can lead to an \"ice cream cone\" appearance as shown below:\n\n\nOption C: Tuberous sclerosis is a multi-system neurocutaneous syndrome caused by the mutation of genes coding for hamartin (chromosome 9) and tuberin (chromosome 16), which leads to the formation of angiomyolipomas, cysts in kidneys, multiple hamartomas, giant cell astrocytomas, and cortical tubers. Skin manifestation includes facial angiofibroma (adenoma sebaceum), shagreen patch and confetti skin lesions. It can also be associated with renal angiomyolipoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma.\n\nThe CT image given below shows calcified subependymal hamartomatous nodules:\n\n\nOption D: Sturge Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder(phakomatoses) that is characterized by unilateral capillary malformation at the region of trigeminal supply known as port wine stain or nevus flammeus, ipsilateral diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the choroid and ipsilateral leptomeningeal hemangiomatosis, which causes seizures and mental retardation.\nFeatures of MRI brain include pial angioma, seen as a diffuse pial enhancement of variable thickness, enlargement of the ipsilateral choroid plexus and dilatation of trans-parenchymal veins that communicate between the superficial and deep cerebral venous systems.\nMRI and CT show intracranial calcification respectively. The tram-track sign in the brain refers to the parallel calcification of the cerebral cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\n\nVein of Galen malformation\nDandy Walker syndrome\nPneumocephalus\nVenous sinus thrombosis\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe MR-Angiography shown is of Vein of Galen Malformation.\nVein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM's), also known as median prosencephalic arteriovenous fistula, are uncommon intracranial anomalies that tend to present in early childhood with features of a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure.\nThe vein of Galen, also known as the great cerebral vein or great vein of Galen, is a short trunk formed by the union of the two internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal. It lies in the quadrigeminal cistern. It curves backwards and upward around the posterior border of the splenium of the corpus callosum and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa.\nThe following image shows the Vein of Galen:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis patient's clinical features and T2W MRI of the brain showing periventricular ovoid hyperintense lesions oriented perpendicular to lateral ventricles, called Dawson's fingers, are characteristic of multiple sclerosis.\nMultiple sclerosis(MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, multiple demyelinating plaques, and relapsing and remitting symptoms.\n\nIt is commonly associated with paresthesia (tingling sensations), hypesthesia (numbness), optic neuritis, unilateral/ bilateral, limb weakness - spastic paralysis, Babinski's sign positive and bladder dysfunction. Optic neuritis (ON) presents as diminished visual acuity or decreased colour perception (desaturation) in the central field of vision.\nMRI is used for making the diagnosis of MS due to its high sensitivity. The diagnosis of MS requires demonstrating that the lesions are disseminated in space (involving multiple areas of the brain) and in time (multiple episodes over a period of time).\nThe MRI below demonstrates Dawson's fingers, the demyelinating plaques through the corpus callosum, arranged at right angles along medullary veins (callososeptal location).\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: A \"puff of smoke appearance\", derived from the Japanese term Moyamoya, is a characteristic finding on cerebral X-ray angiography in patients with Moyamoya disease. This rare, non-inflammatory, progressive, occlusive disease involves large intracranial\narteries exhibiting bimodal age distribution in the first and fourth decades. Childhood moyamoya is characterised by ischemic manifestations, and adult moyamoya by hemorrhagic manifestations.\nThe below image shows the MR angiography findings in a patient with Moyamoya disease.\n\n\n\nAs this is a chronic condition, the lenticulostriate arteries develop a rich collateral circulation around the occlusive lesion, seen as a 'puff of smoke' (moyamoya in Japanese) on X-ray angiography as shown below:\n\n\nOption B: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A, causing central and peripheral demyelination, ataxia, and dementia.\nSymmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared. The below MRI shows tigroid pattern:\n\n\n\nOption D: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy of structures at the midbrain-diencephalic junction (e.g., superior colliculi, red nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, and globus pallidus) and cerebellum (dentate nuclei), and mild cortical atrophy. MRI shows a hummingbird sign (atrophy of midbrain structures with a relatively intact pons region).\n\n\nBrain Tumors, Neurodegenerative & Demyelinating Disorders\n",

Other causes include skull base fractures, neurosurgical procedures, infections (meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess), brain tumours, or the use of nitrous oxide during anaesthesia.\nThe mass effect exerted by the subdural air compresses the underlying brain parenchyma, often resulting from a ball-valve mechanism causing one-way air entry into the subdural space. This raises intracranial pressure (ICP), distinguishing it from non-tension pneumocephalus, which lacks significant mass effect or raised ICP.\nThe elevated ICP leads to rapid clinical deterioration, such as worsening consciousness, necessitating urgent neurosurgical intervention to decompress the trapped air and prevent permanent brain damage.\n\n\n",

Autonomic dysfunction is more severe and generalised, often presenting as orthostatic hypotension. MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominant non-autonomic symptoms:\nMSA-C: Predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy)\nMSA-P: Predominance of Parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration)\nMRI is a valuable diagnostic adjunct, often revealing cerebellar and brainstem atrophy causing pontine hot cross bun sign.\nThe axial T2-weighted image at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles below shows the hot cross bun sign:\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption B: Multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is characterised by atypical parkinsonism that is symmetrical and predominantly axial, with tremors less prominent compared to Parkinson's disease. MRI typically reveals hyperintensities along the lateral aspect of the putamina, and T2-weighted imaging may demonstrate hypointensity in the striatum due to iron deposition. Although not exclusive to MSA, the hot cross bun sign is more commonly seen in MSA-C than in MSA-P.\nOption C: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a form of atypical parkinsonism characterized by slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted vertical eye movements with downward gaze palsy. Patients also have hyperextension of the neck with gait disturbances and frequent falls.

It typically occurs following rapid correction of severe hyponatremia, resulting in hypertonic stress in astrocytes within the brain, causing demyelination without inflammation at the base of the pons, with relative sparing of axons and nerve cells.\nClinically, patients present one or more days after the overcorrection of hyponatremia with paraparesis or quadriparesis, diplopia, a \u201clocked-in syndrome,\u201d dysphagia, and dysarthria with/without loss of consciousness.\nMRI is useful in establishing the diagnosis. Owl's eye appearance on T2 MRI is seen due to sparing of the peripheral pontine fibres and the descending corticospinal tracts.

This CNS infection typically occurs through the consumption of food or water contaminated with human feces containing Taenia eggs or via the ingestion of undercooked pork. It can affect the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space and ventricles.\nClinically, it presents with seizures and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache,\nnausea, vomiting, vision changes), dizziness, ataxia, confusion or signs of meningeal irritation.\nParenchymal neurocysticercosis can be categorised into four stages -vesicular, colloidal vesicular, granular nodular, and nodular calcified. These stages are readily identified on MRI or CT, depending on the lesion's progression. It is characterised by cystic lesions with or without ring enhancement, focal enhancing lesions, nodular calcifications or multilobulated cystic lesions in the subarachnoid space.\nViable parasites appear as cystic lesions with a scolex, often visible on MRI, while calcified, non-viable cysts are more effectively identified on CT.\nDifferential diagnoses for ring-enhancing lesions include brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, central nervous system lymphoma, tuberculoma.\nOther options:\nOption B: Tuberculomas (parenchymal granulomas) can mostly occur at the junction of white and grey matter. On CT, they appear as small rounded lesions, solid lesions show homogenous enhancement on contrast CT and show ring enhancement when central caseation or liquefaction occurs. MRI brain shows &gt;20mm, conglomerate or lobulated irregular shape, ring-enhancing lesion.\n\n\n\nOption C: Primary CNS lymphoma is more common in immunocompromised individuals, though its incidence in HIV patients has decreased with anti-retroviral therapy. Imaging typically shows single or multiple lesions with contrast enhancement, which is uniform in immunocompetent patients and ring-like those who are immunosupressed. Notably, EBV-associated cases in immunocompetent individuals may show rim enhancement.\nOption D: Brain abscess typically presents as a triad of fever, focal neurological deficits and signs of raised intracranial pressure. It is usually seen with a predisposing condition such as cyanotic heart disease, infected sinuses, middle ear or tooth infection, bacterial meningitis and immunodeficiencies. Common causative organisms include streptococci, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, enterobacteriaceae, and staphylococcus aureus.\nThe below MRI shows a ring-enhancing lesion, suggestive of brain abscess.\n\n",

Raw: Question 26:\n\nThe given MRI finding is seen in which of the following conditions?\n\n\nSporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\nVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\nFamilial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\nIatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe given MRI shows the cortical ribbon sign, which is seen in sporadic CJD. This sign refers to the ribbon-like signal hyperintensity of cerebral cortical gyri.\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a spongiform encephalopathy caused by prions. The abnormally folded prion protein (PrPSc) accumulates as plaques, causing degeneration of surrounding neuronal and glial tissue with intracellular vacuoles, leading to the characteristic spongiform encephalopathy. Clinically, it is characterised by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, akinetic mutism, and cerebellar or visual disturbances.\nSubtypes of CJD and imaging features:\nSporadic CJD (sCJD): The most common type, showing cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities on DWI/FLAIR.\nVariant CJD (vCJD): Linked to mad cow disease and Kuru, showing a 'hockey stick' sign on MRI\n(hyperintensity in the pulvinar region of the thalamus).\nFamilial CJD (fCJD): Linked to PRNP gene mutations, showing hyperintensities in the caudate and putamen nuclei on MRI.\nIatrogenic: Caused by prion-contaminated materials\nEEG shows characteristic periodic triphasic or polyphasic sharp wave complexes seen as spikes or spike-wave patterns. CSF is predominantly normal but may show a positive assay for 14-3-3 protein.\nManagement is mainly supportive as the disease is usually fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms.\n\n\n\n\nThe T2-weighted MRI findings suggest Alexander disease, showing hyperintensity in the frontal white matter with bilateral symmetrical involvement.\nAlexander disease is a type of dysmyelinating disease that typically progresses posteriorly to involve the parietal white matter and internal and external capsules, often accompanied by the formation of cysts.\nDysmyelinating diseases, or leukodystrophies, are inherited neurodegenerative disorders that affect the integrity of myelin in the brain and peripheral nerves.\nOther examples of dysmyelinating diseases include:\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy:\nLate infantile (most common), juvenile, and adult types.\nSymmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter.\nRadiating T2-hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively.\nX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: Affects the white matter of the central nervous system, adrenal ortex, and testes.\nCanavan disease: Spongiform leukodystrophy (extensive vacuolization of subcortical white matter).\nMELAS Syndrome: Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes.\nThe following image shows the areas of hyperintensities noted in each of these conditions:\n\n\nUpper GI Radiology and Pneumoperitoneum\n",

Diagnostic features include compact lamellar keratin (\"wet keratin\") and areas of dystrophi calcification.\nPapillary type (common in adults): Contains both solid sheets and papillae lined by well-differentiated non-keratinized squamous epithelium.\nThese tumours are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying solid and cystic components. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid that is compared to 'machine oil'.\nClinical features include headaches (most common), visual abnormalities - decreased acuity and bitemporal hemianopia, GH deficiency, growth failure, delayed sexual maturation due to pituitary hypofunction, and polyuria (central diabetes insipidus).\nRadiologically:\nCT may show calcifications associated with the solid and cystic wall components\nMRI is the imaging modality of choice which shows:\nCraniopharyngiomas tend not to expand the pituitary fossa unless they become huge, which is a differentiating feature from pituitary macroadenomas.\nOther options:\nOption A: Pituitary apoplexy is an acute clinical condition associated with the rapid expansion of the pituitary gland, which is evident on an MRI as enhancement around a non-enhancing infarcted centre.\nOption B: Pituitary macroadenoma (with cystic degeneration or necrosis) shows indentation at the diaphragma sellae, giving rise to a snowman/figure of eight appearance/cottage loaf.

Based on the provided scan image, what is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\nAstrocytoma\n\nMedulloblastoma\nEpendymoma\nCraniopharyngioma\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given MRI is suggestive of medulloblastomas. It is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, and it occurs exclusively in the cerebellum. Irrespective of their histological or genetic characterization, medulloblastomas correspond histologically to WHO grade IV tumors.\nRadiological findings include:\nCT &amp; MRI: CT shows a hyperdense midline vermian mass adjoining the roof of the 4th ventricle and causing hydrocephalus. MRI shows T2 hypointensity or isointensity compared to the grey matter. The CT and MRI findings also reflect the increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and densely packed cells of the tumor.\nDWI: restricted diffusion\nMR spectroscopy: reduced N-acetyl aspartate(NAA) peak with an increased choline-to-creatine ratio.\nThe CT and MRI findings, supported by the presence of restricted diffusion on DWI, are the most reliable observations in differentiating medulloblastoma from ependymoma or other posterior fossa tumors.\nStandard treatment for medulloblastomas includes surgical resection, with adjuvant craniospinal radiotherapy for those over 3 years of age and chemotherapy.\nOther options:\n\nOption A: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a brain tumor that occurs more often in children and young adults. These tumors are usually slow-growing and benign. The majority of neoplasms are located in the cerebellum. However, they can also appear around the third ventricle, optic nerves, spinal cord, and occasionally in the cerebral hemispheres. Mural nodule, a contrast medium enhancing nodule within the wall of a cystic mass, is seen on MRI.\nOption C: Ependymomas are tumours that arise from the ependyma-lined ventricular system, typically on the floor of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. They are well-demarcated lobulated mass lesions that show calcifications on CT in over 50% and are of mixed signal intensity on MRI.\nOption D: Craniopharyngiomas are tumors that arise from the remnants of Rathke\u2019s pouch. It is an intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation. These tumors are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying both solid and cystic components, and occur within the suprasellar area. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid and are compared to machine oil. They also show radiologically demonstrable calcification.\n\n\n",

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\nAstrocytoma\nMeningioma\nPituitary adenoma\nAcoustic Schwannoma\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given axial T1 MRI is suggestive of meningioma. It involves the mid-falx cerebri and is seen as a spontaneously hyperintense and homogeneously enhanced mass in the midline arising from falx.\nMeningiomas are extra-axial tumours (lesions that are outside of the brain parenchyma). They are a non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of the meninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found.\nMeningioma shows female predominance that may be related to the fact that some meningiomas contain estrogen and progesterone receptors. They are also associated with NF-2 gene mutation.\nTypical meningiomas appear as dural-based masses isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging and demonstrate vivid contrast enhancement on both MRI and CT. CSF vascular cleft sign indicates that the mass is extra-axial. There is a cleft between the tumour and normal brain parenchyma.\nThe image below shows the CSF vascular cleft sign:\n\n\n\nDural tail sign: Refers to the linear extension of enhancement of the dura, beyond the segment on which the tumor is based.

These contractions are repetitive, simultaneous, and of high amplitude, but normal peristalsis is preserved between the episodes. This condition is seen most often in females.\nPatients typically present with dysphagia for both solids and liquids, retrosternal non-cardiac chest pain, and symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation and the sensation of food being stuck in the throat.\nAlthough DES may present as a corkscrew or rosary bead esophagus on barium swallow, this finding is uncommon.

It typically presents between 2 to 6 weeks of age with progressive, forceful, non-bilious vomiting immediately after feeding. This results in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of fluid, hydrogen and chloride ions.\nOn examination, a firm, movable, olive-shaped mass is palpable in the epigastrium., often accompanied by visible gastric peristalsis.

The most important prognostic indicators in gastric cancer are - lymph node involvement and depth of tumor invasion. Endoluminal ultrasound and laparoscopic ultrasound are the most sensitive methods in pre-operative local staging of gastric cancer.\nOther options:\nOption A: Standard abdominal ultrasound can be used to investigate the stomach, but it is less sensitive than other modalities in gastric cancer.\nOption B: Barium meal radiology is now used less frequently due to advances in more sensitive diagnostic tools like endoscopy and CT imaging with oral contrast, replacing contrast radiology in investigating gastric malignancies. However, CT remains less accurate in the T-staging of gastric cancer compared to endoluminal ultrasound.\nOption D: Laparoscopy is routine in the assessment of gastric cancer. However, the main limitation is in the evaluation of posterior extension, where CT and endoluminal ultrasound can provide this information.\n\n\n",

It is often associated with trisomy 21/Down syndrome, prematurity, maternal polyhydramnios, cardiac malformations, and malformations of the hepatobiliary system.\nThe range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis, mucosal web with intact muscle wall (so-called windsock deformity), two ends separated by a fibrous cord, and complete separation with a gap within the duodenum.\nOn abdominal X-ray, the double bubble sign represents the dilatation of the stomach and proximal duodenum. This can often be detected prenatally via ultrasound but, if missed, neonates typically present with bilious vomiting shortly after birth, as the obstruction is usually distal to the ampulla of Vater.\nCauses of double bubble sign are congenital obstruction - duodenal atresia (associated with Down syndrome), midgut volvulus, and external compression of the duodenum.\nThe radiological finding obtained on the barium study is a windsock deformity.\n\n\n\n\n",

What is the probable diagnosis?\n\n\nPneumoperitoneum\nPneumomediastinum\n\nPseudopneumoperitoneum\nPseudopneumomediastinum\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given chest X-ray image depicts Chilaiditi sign, characterized by the anterior interposition of the colon between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm, which can mimic air under the diaphragm, leading to pseudo-pneumoperitoneum.\nChilaiditi sign is typically an incidental finding on imaging and is most often asymptomatic. However, when associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension, it is referred to as Chilaiditi syndrome.\nAn erect X-ray showing this sign may mislead clinicians into suspecting pneumoperitoneum, prompting unnecessary urgent surgical intervention, which is not required. To differentiate Chilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a contrast-enhanced CT or a left lateral decubitus radiograph can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loops with haustral markings will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in the peritoneal cavity.\nOther conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus, omental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign.\n\nBelow is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under the diaphragm.\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which is suggestive of pneumoperitoneum. The presence of free intra-abdominal gas almost always indicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Free intraperitoneal gas is also detectable under the hemidiaphragm on an erect chest X-ray as given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption B: The existence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum is referred to as pneumomediastinum. Gas may originate from the peritoneal cavity, lungs, trachea, central bronchi, oesophagus, or peritoneal cavity and travel to the neck or abdomen via the mediastinum. Spinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates with pneumomediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. Other signs of pneumomediastinum are the V sign of Naclerio and continuous diaphragm sign.\nBelow is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence of pneumomediastinum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hence the best views to visualize pneumoperitoneum:\nErect chest X-ray - the first, most important and useful view showing air beneath the diaphragm.\nLeft lateral decubitus abdominal image\nCT abdomen is the most sensitive imaging technique to detect minimal pneumoperitoneum.\n\nThe correct sequence to visualize regions in FAST is subxiphoid \uf0ae right upper quadrant \uf0ae left upper quadrant \uf0ae suprapubic.\nFocussed assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a non-invasive investigation that can be performed rapidly in the emergency room.

The squamous cell carcinoma variant usually affects the upper 2/3rd, and the adenocarcinoma variant usually affects the lower 1/3rd of the esophagus. Clinical features include progressive dysphagia (most common), regurgitation of food, vomiting, odynophagia and weight loss.\nOn barium swallow, carcinoma esophagus presents with irregular narrowing and ulceration of esophagus.

It commonly affects middle-aged women with long-standing anaemia, and is a recognized risk factor for post-cricoid hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It consists of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia and esophageal webs or hypopharyngeal webs.\nEsophageal webs are due to a constriction caused by a thin mucosal membrane projecting into the lumen. More commonly, they are seen in the cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle. They typically arise from the anterior wall, but never from the posterior wall. They may also be circumferential.\nThe image below depicts a barium swallow showing an upper esophageal concentric web in a lateral view.\n\n\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 6:\n\nThe mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus is \t.\nB ring\nA ring\nEsophageal web\nEsophageal stricture\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus is a B-ring.\nDistal esophageal rings are frequent findings on barium contrast X-ray studies. They are of two types:\nB-ring - It occurs at the squamocolumnar junction or gastroesophageal junction. It is lined with squamous epithelium above and columnar epithelium below.\nA-ring - It occurs above the B-ring, i.e., a few centimetres proximal to the gastroesophagea junction. It represents a physiological contraction of esophageal smooth muscle covered by mucosa. A-rings are usually asymptomatic (option B).\nSchatzki ring, also called Schatzki-Gary ring, is a symptomatic narrow B-ring occurring in the distal esophagus. It is usually associated with a hiatus hernia.\n\n\nThe below image is a barium study showing the Schatzki ring located at the gastroesophageal junction, suggestive of hiatus hernia.\n\n\nOther options:\nOption C: Esophageal webs are most common in the upper oesophagus (post-cricoid area), where they are generally semi-circumferential, eccentric lesions that protrude less than 5 mm and have a thickness of 2 to 4 mm. Microscopically, webs are composed of fibrovascular connective tissue and overlying epithelium.\nThe barium swallow below shows the oesophagal web in a patient with Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Oesophagal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophagal tissue consisting of mucosa and submucosa. The translucent part denotes the oesophagal web.\n\n\nOption D: Esophageal stricture refers to any persistent intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus. The causes are peptic stricture (esophagitis induced), corrosives (most common cause), foreign body,\n\npost-surgical, radiotherapy, congenital, tuberculosis, and drugs like tetracycline.\nRadiographic features of benign strictures show smooth tapering with typical concentric narrowing (may affect only one side of the esophagus) while malignant strictures are characteristically abrupt, asymmetric, and eccentric with irregular nodular mucosa. The barium study image below shows esophageal stricture.\n\n\n\n",

The diverticulum is typically noted at the C5-6 level. The outpouching may be transient, sometimes referred to as a pharyngeal pouch. The pouch is best identified during swallowing and is best visualized on the lateral view.\nSince a majority of patients with a Zenker's diverticulum have a hiatal hernia and gastro-oesophageal reflux, the distal esophagus should also be evaluated.\nNote: Killian\u2013Jamieson diverticulum is an outpouching from the lateral wall of the proximal cervical esophagus.\n\n\n",
