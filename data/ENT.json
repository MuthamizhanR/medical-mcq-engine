But, in an ear with otosclerosis of the footplate, there will be no movements and the patient will continue to hear the sound. Thus, Gelle\u2019s test is considered positive in normal persons and in those with sensorineural hearing loss. It is negative when the ossicular chain is fixed or disconnected.\nStenger\u2019s test is done to rule out malingering.\nSchwabach is a tuning fork test that compares the bone conduction of the patient with that of the examiner.\nRinne\u2019s is a tuning fork test that compares bone conduction with air conduction.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 18:\n\nWhat is the definitive treatment of intractable vertigo due to Meniere\u2019s disease?\nAcetazolamide\nLabyrinthectomy\nVestibular neurectomy\nIntratympanic gentamicin\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe definitive treatment of intractable vertigo due to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease is labyrinthectomy.\nLabyrinthectomy involves uniform destruction of hearing and vestibular function. Ideal candidates have no functional hearing and have failed more conservative treatments, such as gentamicin injection. Despite this morbidity, labyrinthectomy has the highest rate of vertigo control (&gt;95%), more than vestibular neurectomy (78-90%), and is considered the single definitive treatment.\nThe step-by-step management approach for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease consists of dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants as the initial measures, followed by intratympanic gentamicin ablation, and finally, surgical intervention.\nPrimarily, the management of Menier's disease involves a sodium restricted diet and diuretics like acetazolamide (Option A). They are more useful for short-term control.\nGentamicin (Option D) is a selective vestibulotoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is preferentially taken up by type I hair cells. It is opted for only if dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants have failed to control the symptoms. If used judiciously, hearing is preserved.\nThe options for surgical management include - Endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular neurectomy, and labyrinthectomy. Endolymphatic sac surgery is currently declining in popularity due to lack of evidence of vertigo control.\n\nVestibular neurectomy (Option C) refers to selective ablation of the vestibular nerve. Even though it is considered a hearing sparing surgery and carries comparable rates of vertigo control as labyrinthectomy, it is an intradural procedure and carries a greater risk of complications. Hearing loss will still progress as it would have in the natural course of illness.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 19:\n\nWhich of the following features is not associated with superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome?\nGaze dependent nystagmus\nPositive Fistula test\nSensorineural hearing loss\nPositive Tulio phenomenon\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nSensorineural hearing loss is not seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome\n(SSCDS). They may experience mild to moderate hearing conductive loss.\nConductive hearing loss is due to the abnormal transmission and dissipation of acoustic energy through the defect (third window), leading to reduced conduction to the cochlea for lower frequencies. This can manifest as a low-frequency air-bone gap at multiple frequencies. There is no defect in the cochlea or the auditory pathway.\nSuperior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition in which bone between the apex of the superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa is absent. This causes endolymph in the labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular system.\nPatients may have vestibular symptoms like vertigo triggered by loud sounds (Tullio phenomenon)or pressure such as coughing and can also experience hyperacusis for\nbone-conducted sounds. They may perceive the sounds of their own eye movements or footsteps in the affected ear.\nThe patients may exhibit nystagmus when exposed to loud sounds or during the Valsalva maneuver or pressure in the ear canal (positive fistula test). The direction of the nystagmus aligns with the affected superior semicircular canal, and some patients may tilt their heads in the plane of the affected superior semicircular canal in response to loud sounds.\nNoncontrast HRCT of the temporal bone can demonstrate the defect. The click-evoked VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potential) response and vestibuloocular reflex are pronounced in SSCD patients, in which the evoked eye movements align with the affected superior canal.\nFor mild symptoms, avoidance of triggers is recommended. In case of severe disabling symptoms, surgical resurfacing of the superior semicircular canal or plugging of the superior semicircular canal may be attempted.\n\n\n",

The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium carbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal.\nA positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver confirms the diagnosis of BPPV. In this maneuver, the patient begins sitting up with their head turned 45 degrees toward the ear to be tested. Then the patient is\n\nmade to lie down quickly with their head past the end of the bed. Then, the patient's neck is extended 20 degrees below the horizontal. The clinician then watches the patient's eyes for torsional and up-beating nystagmus, which should persist for no more than one minute. This would indicate a positive test.\nEpley's maneuver is performed to reposition the crystals into the macula from the semicircular canals. This is only a temporary cure and there is a high rate of recurrence.\n\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The diagnostic maneuver used in BPPV is the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, the gold standard for diagnosing BPPV. The therapeutic maneuver is Epley's maneuver.\nBPPV is one of the common causes of recurrent vertigo, and the episodes are brief (&lt;1min) and are always provoked by changes in head position. The attacks are caused by free-floating calcium carbonate crystals usually dislodged from the posterior canal.\nA patient presenting with vertigo should be evaluated for ruling out the central lesions (like a tumor in the fourth ventricle, multiple sclerosis, etc) before confirming the diagnosis of BPPV. Dix-Hallpike maneuver helps rule out central lesions and also diagnose BPPV.\nDix-Hallpike maneuver:\nThe maneuver starts with the patient in a sitting position.\nTheir head is turned 45 degrees towards the ear to be tested.\nThe examiner quickly brings the patient to a supine position with their head 30 degrees below the horizontal.\nThe 45-degree head rotation is maintained during the procedure.\nNow the examiner observes the patient for nystagmus.\n\n\n\nTumors of Ear\n\n",

They contain yellowish-white cheesy material with fat and epithelium.\nClinical features:\nThe swelling is painless, soft, and freely mobile.\nThough non-transilluminating, they are Paget's test positive (fluctuant).\nPunctum is seen in 70% of the patients with sebaceous cysts. They are dark in color due to the accumulation of denuded epithelium.\nThey also have an unpleasant sebum odor.\nThe swelling can ulcerate and become painful (Cock\u2019s peculiar tumor).\nSome cysts over the scalp may also harden over time (Sebaceous horn).\nMany may get infected and lead to abscess formation. Treatment:\nExcision including skin adjacent to punctum using elliptical incision-dissection method.\nIncision and avulsion of cyst wall.\nIn the presence of an abscess, an initial treatment with an incision later followed by excision of the cyst\nOther options:\nOption A: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types:\nSequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development\nTubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct\nImplantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma\nTeratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm)\nOption C: Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meningothelial cells of the dura. They present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits.\nOption D: Postauricular cutaneous mastoid fistula is a rare complication of chronic otitis media that heals very slowly and needs surgical closure.\n",

It does not contain a ganglion and does not give any branches.\nThe course of the facial nerve has 3 parts-\nIntracranial\nIntratemporal\nExtracranial.\nIntratemporal part of the facial nerve has 4 segments-\nMeatal\nLabyrinthine\nTympanic/horizontal\nMastoid/vertical segments.\nOption A: Gasserian ganglion is present in the trigeminal nerve.\nOption B: The temporal segment of the facial nerve ends with the 2nd genu. The nerve then passes vertically downward to form the mastoid segment. The 2nd branch of facial nerve (nerve to stapedius) arises from this segment close to the level of 2nd genu and not from the 2nd genu.\n\n\n\n\n",

It acts by dampening the loud sounds and the loss of this function results in hyperacusis.\nTensor veli palatini helps in opening the eustachian tube, hence also called dilator tubae muscle.\nTensor tympani, supplied by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, also helps in dampening the loud sounds.

If he still hears the sound, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) i.e. AC&gt;BC. The inferences are as follows:\nRinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC&gt;BC is seen in norma people and people with sensorineural deafness.\nIt is considered negative when the BC&gt;AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness.\nAs a general prediction, a negative Rinne's test with any tuning fork frequency suggests a minimum hearing loss of at least 15 - 20 dB.The table below indicates a rough minimum air-bone gap for negative Rinne's test at different frequencies:\nA prediction of the air-bone gap can be made based on the combination of tuning fork tests of 256, 512, and 1024 Hz:\nA Rinne test negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 20-30 dB.\nA Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 30-45 dB.\nA Rinne test negative for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 45-60 dB.\n\nNegative Rinne te st\nMinimum air-bone gap\n256 Hz\n15 dB\n512 Hz\n30 dB\n1024 Hz\n45 dB\n\n\n",

On examination, the fistula test was negative. What would be the most likely finding on the Rinne test in this scenario?\nTrue positive\nTrue negative\n\nFalse positive\nFalse negative\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given clinical scenario indicates severe sensorineural hearing loss as a consequence of untreated suppurative labyrinthitis and Rinne's test is a false negative in this case.\nInitially, the patient had a positive fistula test, which implies that the labyrinth is still functioning. Rinne's test is positive which could be due to normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.\nCurrently, the patient has a negative fistula test which implies that the labyrinth is dead. This is an example of severe sensorineural hearing loss and here, Rinne test is a false negative.\nIf intermittent pressure applied to the external ear produces vertigo and nystagmus, it is a positive fistula test. The pressure changes in the external ear are transmitted to the labyrinth. This is suggestive of abnormal communication between the middle ear and the inner ear.\n\n\n",

The Rinne test is positive in both ears and Weber is lateralized towards the right. What is the interpretation?\nRight-sided conductive deafness\nLeft-sided conductive deafness\nRight-sided sensorineural deafness\nLeft-sided sensorineural deafness\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe patient has left-sided sensorineural deafness.\nWeber's test lateralized towards the right indicates right-sided conductive deafness or left-sided sensorineural deafness. Since Rinne's test is positive on both the ears, conductive deafness can be ruled out and hence, the interpretation here is left-sided sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) damages the outer hair cells, starting in the basal turn of the cochlea. Outer hair cells are affected before the inner hair cells.\nNIHL occurs after chronic exposure to less intense sounds. The damage caused by noise trauma depends on the frequency of noise (frequency of 2000 to 3000 Hz causes more damage) intensity, duration of the noise, and preexisting ear disease.\nThe audiogram in noise-induced hearing loss shows a typical notch at 4000Hz both for air and bone conduction known as acoustic dip/boiler's notch. Patients at this stage complain of\nhigh-pitched tinnitus and difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings. Pre-employment and annual audiograms for persons working at places where noise is above 85 dB (A) help in the early\n\ndetection of NIHL.\nThe human ear can hear frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the vibrations are infra-audible, and above 20,000 Hz, they are ultra-sonic. Pure tone audiometry can detect only up to 8000 Hz.\nExtended high-frequency audiometry is recommended for early detection of hearing loss, as it can identify hearing impairments before the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension are affected. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions is a more sensitive tool than conventional audiometry, particularly in children under 5 years old for early detection of hearing loss.\nA noise of \u02dc0 dB(A) SPL (acceptable noise levels, sound pressure level), 8 hours a day for 5 days per week is the maximum safe limit as recommended by the Ministry of Labour. As per WHO, 85 dB(A) is considered the highest safe exposure level up to a maximum of 8 hours.\nThe silence zone extends to a distance of 100 meters around the premises of hospitals, nursing homes, educational institutions, and courts.\nPermissible limits of noise as per the noise pollution (Regulation and Control) rules:\nNoise levels are measured in dB(A), which prioritizes middle-range frequencies for assessing noise-induced hearing loss while giving less weightage to low and high frequencies.\nThe image below shows an acoustic dip at 4000Hz:\n\n\u2122one/Are a\nDay(6 am to 10 pm) limits in dB(A)\nNight(10 pm to 6 am) limits i n dB(A)\nIndustria\n75\n70\nCommerc ia\n65\n55\nResidenti al\n55\n45\nSilence\n50\n40\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Crista ampullaris is a thickened ridge of neuroepithelium in the ampullated end of semicircular ducts.\nOption B: Macula is the sensory epithelium of the utricle\nOption C: Cupula is a gelatinous mass extending from the surface of the crista (peripheral receptor located in the ampullated end of semicircular ducts) to the ceiling of the ampulla, into which project the cilia of sensory hair cells.\n\nAudiometric tests and Special tests of hearing\n",

Normal SP: AP ratio is &lt;30% but it is increased in Meniere\u2019s disease.\n\n",

So lateral lemniscus is the better option.\nCurrent Diagnosis and Treatment in Otorhinolaryngology- auditory brainstem response waves 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent the sequential activation of neurons as the signal is passed up the brainstem from the proximal part of the cochlear nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus.\nNIH Journals- generation of wave V reflects the activity of multiple anatomic auditory structures. A sharp positive peak of wave V arises mainly from the lateral lemniscus, following a slow negative wave represents dendritic potential in the inferior colliculus.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 18:\n\nWhile performing a caloric test, what type of nystagmus would you expect on cold water irrigation?\nHorizontal nystagmus towards the same side\nVertical nystagmus towards the same side\nHorizontal nystagmus towards the opposite side\nVertical nystagmus towards the opposite side\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 18:\nIn caloric testing, cold water irrigation produces horizontal nystagmus towards the opposite side of irrigation. The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic, COWS (cold\u2013opposite, warm\u2013same).\nThe mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a temperature gradient by the cold water, which pulls the cupula away from the utricle, causing nystagmus towards the oppsite side. As the horizontal semicircular canal is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it and the nystagmus is horizontal.\nThe Fitzgerald\u2013Hallpike test (bithermal caloric test) is done to assess this phenomenon. The patient lies in a supine position with head tilted forward at a 30\u00b0 angle, ensuring the horizontal canal becomes vertical. Alternatingly, water at temperatures of 30\u00b0C and 44\u00b0C (7\u00b0 below and above normal body temperature, respectively) is irrigated into the ears for a duration of 40 seconds each. The examiner closely observes the patient's eyes for the emergence of nystagmus until its endpoint is reached. The time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of nystagmus is recorded and plotted on a calorigram.\nIf no nystagmus is evoked from either ear, the test is repeated with water at a temperature of 20\u00b0C for a duration of 4 minutes before labeling the labyrinth dead. A 5-minute interval should be allowed between testing each ear to ensure accurate results.\n\n\n\nBERA, OAE, and tympanometry are the objective tests for hearing. PTA (pure tone audiometry) is a subjective test for hearing as it relies on patient responses to pure tone stimuli. Other examples of subjective tests include tuning fork tests and speech audiometry.\nTympanometry is an objective test of the middle ear and eustachian tube functions (conductive compartment of hearing). Here, the compliance of the TM, i.e., how much it moves to the pressure differentials applied from the external ear is measured.\nThe image below shows the types of tympanogram:\n\n\n\nAnatomy of Nose\n\n",

What is the diagnosis?\n\n\nOtotoxicity\nMeniere disease\nOtosclerosis\nNoise induced hearing loss\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe clinical scenario describes a patient with post-pregnancy hearing loss. The audiogram shows conductive deafness along with Carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz). These findings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis.\nOtotoxicity, Meniere\u2019s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss\n(SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss.\nOtosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy and menopause.\nStapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae.\nThe presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the Schwartze sign, suggests an active focus. PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap, more for lower frequencies and Carhart's notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.\nMedical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment is stapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. Carhart notch usually disappears\n\nafter a successful stapedectomy. Other options:\nOption A: Ototoxicity causes SNHL and shows a high-frequency hearing loss in the SNHL curve.\nOption B: In Meniere's disease, pure tone audiometry shows an SNHL pattern with a rising curve in the early stages (as lower frequencies are involved first) and as the disease progresses higher frequencies are involved, the curve becomes flat or a falling type.\nOption D: Noise-induced hearing loss is SNHL and PTA shows a characteristic acoustic dip at 4000 Hz both for air and bone conduction.\n\n\n",

The nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus, hence it will not be visualized here.\nOption A: Agger nasi is an elevation just anterior to the attachment of the middle turbinate. When pneumatised and enlarged it encroaches on the frontal recess area and causes mechanical obstruction to drainage of the frontal sinus leading to sinusitis.\nOption B: Atrium of the middle meatus is a shallow depression lying in front of the middle turbinate and above the nasal vestibule.\nOption C: Fronto-nasal duct/frontal recess is the opening of the frontal sinus into the infundibulum.\nNote: In diagnostic nasal endoscopy three passes are performed -\nFirst pass is the examination of the nasopharynx and inferior meatus.\nSecond pass is the examination of sphenoethmoidal recess, superior meatus, and openings of sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoidal cells.\nThird pass is the examination of the middle meatus in detail.\n\n\n\n\n",

Weak odors need to be sniffed, due to the same.\nThe upper 1/3rd of the nasal cavity forms the olfactory area which is also known as the dangerous area of the nose. Olfactory nerve fibers pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. Spread of infection to the intracranial space can occur through this route. Trauma to the cribriform plate\n\ncan lead to CSF rhinorrhea.\nIt is bounded by the following structures:\nLaterally by superior turbinate\nMedially by corresponding part of the septum\nSuperiorly by cribriform plate of the ethmoid It is lined by olfactory epithelium.\nNote: The danger triangle of the face consists of the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose.

The surface ectoderm on each side of the rhombencephalon thickens to form otic/auditory placodes, which then invaginate to form the otic vesicle (otocysts).\nThe cells of the otic vesicle differentiate to form ganglion cells, which later develop into the vestibulocochlear ganglia. Later each otic vesicle divides into a dorsal component called pars superior and a ventral component called pars inferior.\nPars superior gives rise to the utricle, semicircular canals, and endolymphatic ducts. Pars inferior gives rise to saccule and cochlear duct. The saccule is connected to the cochlea through a narrow duct called ductus reuniens.\n\n\n",

Which of the following is the method of protection of the lower airway that's compromised in this patient?\n\n\n\nTemperature regulation\nHumidification\nMucociliary mechanism\nMucosal defense with immunoglobulins\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given clinical scenario of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and the X-ray showing dextrocardia (situs inversus) is suggestive of Kartagener syndrome. The mucociliary mechanism is compromised in this case, due to immotile cilia.\nThe lower airway is protected by the following mechanisms:\nMucociliary mechanism - The inspired pathogens and dust are trapped on the viscous mucous blanket. By beating of the cilia, the mucus is carried to the nasopharynx to be swallowed.\nChemical mechanisms - Immunoglobulins such as IgA, IgE, and Lactoferrin, lysozyme provide innate immunity.\nSneezing - It is a protective reflex due to irritation of the nasal mucosa.\n\nTemperature regulation and humidification are due to the large surface area of mucosa and highly vascular cavernous spaces. This is achieved by an increase or decrease in blood flow which in turn increase or decrease the size of turbinates.\n\n\n",

The artery which is most commonly ligated in a case of refractory posterior epistaxis is the sphenopalatine artery.\nPosterior epistaxis is most commonly seen in older age groups. The bleeding is spontaneous, often due to hypertension, and is severe, requiring hospitalization. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period, each requiring medical attention.\nSphenopalatine artery ligation gives high success in the control of refractory posterior\nbleed.

Hence if the bleeding is not controlled by external carotid artery ligation, the subsequent step would be to ligate the ethmoidal artery.\nEpistaxis may be classified as anterior or posterior epistaxis.\nLittle's area is situated in the anterior inferior part of the nasal septum, just above the vestibule. It is the site of epistaxis in 90% of the cases.\nFour arteries anastomose here to form a vascular plexus called the Kiesselbach\u2019s plexus. This area is exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory current and to fingernail trauma and is the usual site for epistaxis in children and young adults.\nThe four contributing arteries are as follows:\nSeptal branch of sphenopalatine and greater palatine branches of the maxillary artery, which in turn is a branch of the external carotid artery.\nSeptal branch of the superior labial artery which in turn is a branch of the facial artery.

Medical management is the mainstay treatment for rhinoscleroma. Streptomycin(1 g/day) and tetracycline (2 g/day) are given for a minimum of 4-6 weeks and continued till 2 consecutive biopsies are negative. Surgery is reserved to establish airway or correct deformity.\nBiopsy in the case of rhinoscleroma shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells, and Russell bodies.\nMikulicz cells are large foam cells with a central nucleus and vacuolated cytoplasm containing causative bacilli.\nRussell bodies are homogenous eosinophilic inclusion bodies found in the plasma cells. They occur due to the accumulation of immunoglobulins secreted by the plasma cells.\nThe following image shows rhinoscleroma with Mikulicz cells.\n\n\nH&amp;E showing a mixture of plasma cells (arrow), lymphocytes (short arrow), Miculikz cells which are vacuolated macrophages containing causative bacilli (double arrow).\nOption A: Rhinoscleroma is endemic in several parts of the world.

There is no history of allergen exposure or asthma in the family. You are suspecting vasomotor rhinitis. Which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?\nIt is an allergic condition.\nIt occurs due to sympathetic overactivity.\nVidian neurectomy is a treatment option.\nPale and atrophied turbinates are seen.\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 16:\nVidian neurectomy is a treatment option in vasomotor rhinitis.\nVasomotor rhinitis is a non-allergic condition that occurs due to parasympathetic overactivity, causing vasodilatation and congestion of nasal mucosa. The vidian nerve carries the parasympathetic supply to the nose.\nThe usual presentation is excessive rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction which is similar to allergic rhinitis. But the turbinates will be congested and edematous.\nTreatment includes antihistamines, oral nasal decongestants, and topical steroids. In case of failed medical treatment, vidian neurectomy is done.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 17:\n\nProlonged use of which of the following drugs can cause rhinitis medicamentosa?\nSteroid nasal spray\nNasal decongestants\nAntihistamines\nLeukotreine receptor antagonists\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nRhinitis medicamentosa is caused by the prolonged use of nasal decongestants.\nThe treatment includes the withdrawal of nasal decongestant drops, a short course of systemic steroid therapy, and in some cases, surgical reduction of turbinates if they have become hypertrophied.\n\n\n\nComplete closure of the nostrils (Young's operation) or partial closure of the nostrils (Modified Young's operation) is done for the treatment of atrophic rhinitis.\nIn Young's operation, both nostrils are closed completely by raising flaps within the nasal vestibule. They are opened after 6 months. During this time, the mucosa becomes normal, and the crusting is reduced.\nIn Modified Young's operation, the procedure has been modified to avoid discomfort from complete closure of the nostrils. Here the nostrils are only partially closed. The results are the same when compared to Young's operation.\n\nAtrophic rhinitis (ozaena) is a chronic inflammation of the nose with atrophy of nasal mucosa and turbinate bones. Roomy nasal cavities with foul-smelling crusts are seen. The patient presents with a foul smell from the nose, marked anosmia (merciful anosmia), and paradoxical nasal obstruction (nasal obstruction despite wide nasal passages). Paradoxical nasal obstruction occurs due to degenerative changes in the sensory nerves of the nasal mucosa, leading to an inability to sense airflow.\nMedical management includes nasal irrigation and removal of crusts. 25% glucose in glycerine, antibiotics (quinolones or metronidazole), estradiol nasal spray, and mucolytics can be used.\n\nDisorder of Nasal Septum and Nasal Polyposis\n",

In most cases, the deformity is due to edema. So, ice packs and head elevation are advised initially after injury. After 3-5 days, the edema would subside and the underlying deformity will be apparent on clinical assessment.\nAfter 2 weeks it is difficult to reduce since the process of callus formation and the bony and fibrous union would have started.\n\n\n",

The glossopharyngeal nerve and the styloid process lie in relation to the lower part of the tonsillar fossa. Therefore, any irritation or pain can be referred to the ear along the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal (Jacobson's) nerve.\nCauses of referred otalgia via the glossopharyngeal nerve include acute pharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, post-tonsillectomy, foreign bodies embedded in the base of the tongue or tonsillar area and an elongated styloid process (Eagle's syndrome).\nThe ear receives extensive sensory innervation via four cranial nerves (V, VII, IX, and X) and two spinal segments (C2 and C3).\nThe image below shows the anatomic relations of the tonsil and tonsillar bed:\n\n\n\n",

Which of the following types of tonsillitis may be implicated in this condition?\nAcute membranous\nAcute follicular\nChronic fibroid\n\nChronic parenchymatous\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical presentation is suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome(OSAS) secondary to chronic parenchymatous tonsillitis.\nIn parenchymatous tonsillitis, the tonsils grow very large following repeated attacks of acute tonsillitis and lead to obstructive symptoms, including OSAS.\nTypes of chronic tonsillitis:\nChronic follicular tonsillitis- tonsillar crypts are full of infected cheesy material, which shows on the surface as yellowish spots.\nChronic parenchymatous tonsillitis- there is hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue. Tonsils are very much enlarged and may interfere with speech, deglutition, and respiration. Attacks of sleep apnoea may occur. Long-standing cases develop features of cor pulmonale.\nChronic fibroid tonsillitis- tonsils are tiny but infected, with a history of repeated sore throats.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is a condition due to blockage of a tonsillar crypt and appears as a yellowish swelling over the tonsil. Very often, it is symptomless and can be easily drained.\nOption A: Intratonsillar abscess is an accumulation of pus within the substance of the tonsil. It usually follows a blockage of the opening of the crypt in acute follicular tonsillitis. There is marked local pain and dysphagia. Tonsil appears swollen and red.\nOption B: Tonsilloliths (calculus of the tonsil) are seen in chronic tonsillitis when its crypt is blocked with retention of debris. Inorganic salts of calcium and magnesium are then deposited leading to the formation of a stone. It may gradually enlarge and then ulcerate through the tonsil. It generally causes local discomfort or foreign body sensation.\n\nOption D: In follicular tonsillitis, purulent material is present at the opening of the crypts as yellow dots.

Trismus is seen in pre-styloid abscess due to the involvement of medial pterygoid muscle.\nParapharyngeal space is divided into two compartments by the styloid process and its attachments. Clinical features depend on the compartment involved.\nIn a post-styloid abscess, there is a bulge of the pharynx behind the posterior pillar, accompanied by paralysis of cranial nerves IX, X (resulting in vocal cord paralysis), XI, XII, and the sympathetic chain, which can manifest as Horner's syndrome. Swelling in the parotid region may also be present. Notably, trismus, the inability to fully open the mouth, is usually absent in this type of abscess.\nA pre-styloid abscess exhibits distinct features including the prolapse of the tonsil and tonsillar fossa, along with trismus caused by the spasm of the medial pterygoid muscle. Marked odynophagia is common. Additionally, an external swelling can be observed behind the angle of the jaw.\nFever, sore throat, torticollis (caused by spasm of the prevertebral muscles), and signs of systemic toxicity are common features.\nDiagnosis can be established using a contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT). If there is suspicion of thrombosis of the internal jugular vein or an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) can be useful.\nPatients require intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, carbapenem antibiotics plus drugs that target anaerobic organisms, such as clindamycin or metronidazole. A parapharyngeal abscess is drained by an external horizontal incision made on the skin a few centimeters below the angle of the mandible.\nThe image attached below shows the components of both spaces:\n\n\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 19:\n\nA 50-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, post-op day 5 of major abdominal surgery has developed high-grade fever and swelling over the parotid area. On examination, there is tenderness, induration and pus exuding from the Stenson\u2019s duct on applying pressure over the parotids. Which of the following options is not a likely cause for the above condition?\nDehydration\nStaphylococcus aureus\nOral infections\nExcessive gland stimulation\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe above clinical scenario is suggestive of a parotid abscess and excessive gland stimulation is not a cause for its formation.\nEtiology of Parotid Abscess:\nDehydration, particularly in postsurgical cases (5-7 post-op days) and debilitated patients, with stasis of salivary flow is the predisposing cause.\nInfection from the oral cavity travels via the Stenson\u2019s duct to invade the parotid gland (retrograde spread of infection). The most common organism is Staphylococcus aureus but Streptococci, anaerobic organisms, and rarely the gram negative organisms have also been cultured.\n\n\n\nIn a case of a parotid abscess, one must never wait for fluctuation or pus point to occur. This is because the superficial layer of parotidomasseteric fascia is tense and the fluctuation will be apparent only in later stages.\nA parotid abscess refers to an infection and pus formation in the parotid space. It is caused most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. Post-surgical cases and debilitated patients with stasis of salivary flow are at risk of developing parotid abscesses.\nPatients typically present with unilateral swelling, redness, induration, and tenderness over the parotid gland and angle of the mandible. Dehydration and fever are also present. Diagnosis is by ultrasonography or a CT scan. Multiple small loculi of pus are seen in the parenchyma. Aspiration of abscess can be done to determine the culture and sensitivity of the infective agent.\n\nCorrection of dehydration, improving oral hygiene and promoting salivary flow. Intravenous antibiotics are also used in treatment.\nSurgical drainage under local or general anesthesia is carried out by a preauricular incision as employed for parotidectomy.

It is often produced in obstructive lesions of supraglottis or pharynx, e.g. laryngomalacia or retropharyngeal abscess.\n\nExpiratory stridor is produced in lesions of thoracic trachea, primary and secondary bronchi such as bronchial foreign body, and tracheal stenosis.\nBiphasic stridor is seen in lesions of glottis, subglottis, and cervical trachea like laryngeal papillomas, vocal cord paralysis, and subglottic stenosis.\nStridor is an audible respiratory noise that gets produced by turbulent airflow through an obstructed upper airway. It is an inspiratory sound that may have an expiratory component. It is distinct from stertor which is a snoring-like noise produced from an obstructed nasopharynx or oropharynx.\nThe intensity and pitch of sounds originating from the respiratory system vary based on their site of origin within the respiratory tract and may be heard with or without a stethoscope. Usually, the pitch of the sound increases, and the intensity decreases as one goes lower into the respiratory tract.\n\n\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 11:\n\nIdentify the lesion of vocal cord in the image given below :\n\n\nReinke\u2019s edema\nMalignancy\n\nTracheomalacia\nLaryngeal papilloma\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe image showing grape-like projections, involving the anterior part of the vocal cords depicts a laryngeal papilloma.\nLaryngeal papilloma is a benign tumor of the larynx caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV type 6 and 11). They can occur in children, most commonly around 3 -5 years of age (juvenile papillomatosis), as well as in adults. They involve the supraglottic and glottic regions of the larynx. Seeding of the lesions can occur during invasive laryngeal procedures, such as intubation. They have a high recurrence rate and very low potential for malignancy.\nAdult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis is less common and usually seen in males aged 30-50 years. It is less aggressive and involves the anterior part of the vocal cords. The treatment is the same as juvenile papillomatosis.\nPatients present with hoarseness, aphonia, dyspnea, or stridor. Laryngoscopy shows pinkish to white grape-like projections that can be sessile or pedunculate with a visible central vascular core. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consists\nof micro-laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision.\nThe image below depicts laryngeal papillomatosis on laryngoscopy:\n\n\nReinke's edema (Option A) is a collection of fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke. It generally occurs in patients with vocal abuse or smoking. The vocal cords will show diffuse, symmetrical swelling.\nThe laryngoscopic image below shows Reinke's edema:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario of a child presenting with chronic hoarseness (3 months) of voice and respiratory distress for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of respiratory papillomatosis (juvenile papillomatosis).\nCroup (Option A) and acute epiglottitis (Option D), which cause acute upper respiratory tract obstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In croup, the upper airway obstruction becomes apparent after 1 to 3 days of low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. On the other hand, in epiglottitis, a child experiences respiratory distress within hours of developing a fever.\nVocal nodules (Option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress.\nRespiratory papillomatosis is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They are simple warts (benign tumors) caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 commonly seen in children aged 3 to 5 years.\nThe course involves remissions and exacerbations of recurrent papillomas, mostly affecting the glottic area (vocal cords), and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worsening hoarseness, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea, stridor, and severe airway obstruction if left untreated.\nDiagnosis confirmed by direct laryngoscopy, which shows grape-like projections (shown below), and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. Antivirals like interferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies.\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The patient initially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough,\nlow-grade fever) followed by a characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor.\nOption C: Vocal nodule (singer\u2019s or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse. They appear symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two third of the v cal cord. The patient presents with chronic hoarseness and voice fatigue.\nThe image below shows symmetric vocal nodules:\n\n\nOption D: Acute epiglottitis is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive course of high-grade fever, dyspnea, and stridor.\n\nVoice and Speech Disorders\n\n",

Which of the following is the most effective single treatment for this condition?\nMedicated wicks\nAural toilet\nAntibiotics\nAnalgesics\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe clinical scenario is suggestive of diffuse otitis externa following a trauma. Aural toilet remains the most effective single treatment for this condition.\nAll exudate and debris should be carefully removed, with special emphasis on the anteroinferior meatal recess, which forms a blind pocket and acts as a reservoir of infective secretion. The aural toilet can be done by dry mopping, suction clearance, or irrigating the canal with warm, sterile normal saline.\nFurther treatment modalities:\nAfter the aural toilet is done, wicks medicated with antibiotic-steroid preparation can be used. These wicks have to be changed daily for 2 to 3 days, which thereafter can be substituted by ear drops.\n\nBroad-spectrum systemic antibiotics are used when there is cellulitis and acute tender ymphadenitis.\nAnalgesics are usually a part of management, as otitis externa is associated with severe pain.\nGauze wick soaked in 10% ichthammol glycerine is used to reduce swelling.\nAstringents such as aluminum acetate (8%) or silver nitrate (3%) are used to dry up an oozing meatus.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 22:\n\nWhile performing syringing for a patient with impacted wax, along which wall of the meatus would you direct the jet of water?\nAnterosuperior wa\nPosterosuperior wa\nAnteroinferior wa\nPosteroinferior wa\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 22:\nDuring syringing, the pinna is pulled upwards and backward and the water jet is directed along the posterosuperior wall of the meatus. This is preferred because of two anatomical reasons:\nOn maneuvering the pinna to bring the EAC into a straight configuration, the posterior wall is straighter and easily accessible than the anterior wall.\nThe posteroinferior wall of EAC is supplied by the vagus. Direct stimulation of this can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.\nComplications of syringing:\nVertigo\u2013 caloric stimulation of lateral semicircular canal if water is too hot or too cold\nRupture of the tympanic membrane\nReactivation of quiescent otitis media, if there is pre-existing perforation Contraindications for syringing:\nPresence of ear infection, tympanic membrane perforation\nPresence of grommet or history of ear surgery\n\n\n",

It is performed in combination with all canal wall-down procedures like modified radical and radical mastoidectomies, for easy access to the mastoid cavity for periodic inspection and cleaning.\nIt is also done as an isolated procedure in elderly people with sagging auricles. A\nsagging auricle causes obstruction to the meatus leading to the retention of wax and difficulty in hearing.\nOther options:\nOption B: Tympanoplasty is the surgical reconstruction to correct damage in the middle ear and restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane for improved hearing. It is ossicular reconstruction only or ossicular reconstruction with myringoplasty.\nOption C: Myringoplasty refers to the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane only.

Since the fluid is clear, one can see the structures of the middle ear quite clearly on otoscopy.\nPatients having serous otitis media will have hearing loss that rarely exceeds 40 dB. This deafness can pass unnoticed, and maybe accidentally discovered during audiometric screening tests.\nBecause of hearing loss, the development of speech is delayed or defective. Otoscopic findings in serous otitis media:\nFluid level and air bubbles are seen when fluid is thin and the tympanic membrane transparent.\nIn chronic cases, the fluid becomes very sticky. Hence, the name glue ear.\nThe tympanic membrane is often dull and opaque with a loss of light reflex.\nThe mobility of the tympanic membrane is restricted.\n\n\n",

It is an inflammation of the inner wall of the lateral venous sinus with the formation of an intrasinus thrombus.\nClinical features of lateral sinus thrombophlebitis:\nHectic picket fence fever with chills and rigors. This is due to septicemia. The clinical picture resembles malaria but lacks regularity.\nHeadache - In the early stage, it may be due to peri-sinus abscess and is mild. Later, it may be severe when intracranial pressure rises due to venous obstruction.\nGriesinger\u2019s sign - this is due to thrombosis of the mastoid emissary vein. Edema appears over the posterior part of the mastoid.\nPapilloedema - its presence depends on obstruction to venous return. It is often seen with the right sinus (which is larger than the left).\nTenderness along the jugular vein - This is seen when thrombophlebitis extends along the jugular vein. There may be associated enlargement and inflammation of the jugular chain of ymph nodes and torticollis.\nInvestigations:\nBlood culture\nCSF analysis - normal except for increased CSF pressure that helps in ruling out meningitis.\nX-ray mastoid shows:\nClouding of air cells seen in acute mastoiditis.\nDestruction of bone seen in cholesteatoma.\nCECT shows a typical delta sign.\n\n\nTreatment:\nIntravenous antibacterial therapy\nMastoidectomy and exposure of sinus\nLigation of internal jugular vein\nAnticoagulant therapy\n\n\n\nThe image shows a cherry-red small mass of granulation tissue arising from the pars flaccida of the left tympanic membrane strongly suggesting that there is an underlying cholesteatoma in the attic area. Surgery is the treatment of choice in case of cholesteatoma.\nThe continuing discharge from the granulation tissue has caused the surface epithelia of the tympanic membrane to become edematous and thickened. This gives the surface of the tympanic membrane a thickened whitish appearance.\nThe primary aim in surgical treatment is to remove the disease and render the ear safe, and second in priority is to preserve or reconstruct hearing but never at the cost of the primary aim. Mastoidectomy is done.\n\nOtosclerosis\n\n",
