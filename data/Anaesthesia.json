    "explanation": "\nNitrous oxide is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Hence it is avoided in patients at high risk of PONV.\nPONV has an incidence of 20-30% in general surgical population and 70-80% in those with predisposing risk factors.\nRisk factors for PONV:\nPatient-specific: Female gender, non-smoking status, history of motion sickness/PONV\nAnesthetic-specific: Nitrous oxide, volatile anesthetics, opioids\nSurgery-specific: Increased duration of surgery, type of surgery Drugs used in the prophylaxis and treatment of PONV:\n5-HT 3 antagonists - ondansetron, palonosetron\nButyrophenones- droperido\nDexamethasone\nTransdermal scopolamine\nNote: Propofol has antiemetic property and thus reduces the risk of PONV."

True allergic reactions to opioids like fentanyl are very rare.\nThe most common cause of anaphylactic reactions during anesthesia is antibiotics (especially penicillin and cephalosporin), followed by neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium).\nAmino ester local anesthetics (procaine) exhibit allergic reactions due to the metabolite PABA. Sulfa drugs like sulfonamide antibiotics, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and captopril also exhibit allergy in surgical patients."

    "explanation": "\nThe clinical features are suggestive of postoperative hypothermia and shivering in this\npatient. Remifentanil is known to cause postoperative shivering when given in high doses and has no role in the treatment of this patient.\nPostoperative hypothermia is defined as a core temperature &lt; 36\u00b0C. Postoperative shivering is usually, but not always, associated with hypothermia. The primary cause of postoperative shivering is perioperative hypothermia. The most efficient way to reduce post-anaesthetic shivering is to prevent hypothermia by avoiding cold epidural and intravenous fluids.\nTreatment-\nMeperidine is the most effective treatment for post-anesthetic hypothermia and shivering.\nOpioids(Tramadol), ondansetron, clonidine, physostigmine and ketamine have been shown to be effective in abolishing shivering.\nIntraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine has been shown to be an effective prophylactic."
