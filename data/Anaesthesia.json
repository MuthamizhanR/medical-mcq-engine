He performed spinal anesthesia using the local anesthetic cocaine.\nSpinal anesthesia involves the administration of a local anesthetic into the spinal subarachnoid space to provide motor and sensory blockade. Another contribution by August Bier is 'Bier's block' or IVRA (intravenous regional anesthesia).\n\nJohn Lundy: coined the term balanced anesthesia.\nCarl Koller: proposed local anesthetic property of cocaine. Oliver Wendell: coined the term anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe image shown above is the anesthesia workstation.\nThe prototype of this device is Boyle's machine which was first invented by Edmund Gaskin Boyle in 1917. Boyle\u2019s machine, which is used to provide anaesthesia, has evolved over the years into\nanesthetic workstations, which are currently in use. John Lundy: coined the term balanced anesthesia.\nCarl Koller: proposed local anesthetic property of cocaine. Oliver Wendell: coined the term anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 4:\nJohn Lundy coined the term balanced anaesthesia in 1926.\nHe was instrumental in the formation of the American Board of Anesthesiology and chaired the American Medical Association\u2019s Section on Anesthesiology for 17 years.\nBalanced anaesthesia involves the use of multiple anaesthetic agents and techniques to produce the different components of anaesthesia, i.e.:\nAnalgesia\nAmnesia\nMuscle relaxation\nAbolition of autonomic reflexes\nOption B: James Young Simpson introduced chloroform Option C: Edmund Boyle invented the anaesthetic machine Option D: Oliver Wendell coined the term anaesthesia\nSolution to Question 5:\nOctober 16th 1846 is significant due to the demonstration of ether anesthesia by William Thomas Green Morton at Ether Dome at Massachusetts General Hospital.\nThe first public demonstration of surgical anesthesia:\n\nOn this day, W.T.G. Morton administered ether to Gilbert Abbott for the removal of a tumor from his jaw by the surgeon Dr. John Collin Warren.

Joseph Priestley: First synthesized nitrous oxide.\nJohn Lundy: Coined the term balanced anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 7:\nCocaine was the first topical anaesthetic and was discovered by Carl Koller in 1884.\nHe first introduced cocaine as a topical anaesthetic for ophthalmologic surgery of the cornea. Thereafter, cocaine was used for intradermal infiltration and nerve blocks by William Halsted.\nJoseph Priestley: First synthesized nitrous oxide.\nHumphrey Davy: Experimented with nitrous oxide and named it laughing gas. William Morton: Introduced ether anaesthesia.\nSolution to Question 8:\nJohn Snow is the Father of Anesthesia.\nHe administered chloroform to Queen Victoria at the birth of her eighth son, Leopold in 1853 and performed the same procedure when her daughter Beatrice was born in April 1857.\nWilliam Morton is considered the father of modern anesthesia for his public demonstration of ether anesthesia.\nJohn Snow\n\nJohn Snow is considered one of the founders of epidemiology for his work identifying the source of a cholera outbreak in 1854. He was a firm believer of 'germ' theory of disease which was not widely accepted until the 1860s.\n\nBroadwick Street showing the John Snow memorial and public house. John Snow had the handle of the pump removed following a cholera outbreak in August 1854.\nSolution to Question 9:\nJoseph Priestley first synthesized nitrous oxide in 1772.\nJoseph Priestley, an English chemist is well known for his experiments and observations on different kinds of air. He is most famously known for the discovery of \"dephlogisticated air,\" which was later named oxygen by Lavoisier.\nHumphry Davy, in 1800, first noted the analgesic properties of nitrous oxide.\nHorace Wells studied the analgesic properties of nitrous oxide and put into clinical use in 1844 for dental extraction but it was less potent than ether.\nWilliam Morton introduced ether anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 10:\nPassive euthanasia is legal in India, since 9 March 2018. Prior to this, it was legal only in Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.\nEuthanasia involves the administration of medication by someone other than the patient for the purpose of ending the patient\u2019s life in the belief that it is best for the patient (but not necessarily at the specific request of the patient).\nInvoluntary euthanasia, which is done against the patient\u2019s consent, is illegal in all countries and amounts to murder.\nTypes of euthanasia:\nActive euthanasia: Direct administration of a lethal substance to the patient by another party with merciful intent\nPassive euthanasia: Withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment either at the equest of the patient or when prolonging life is considered futile\nIndirect euthanasia: Prescription of painkillers that may be fatal in an attempt to relieve suffering\nPhysician-assisted suicide: A medical professional aiding a patient in terminating their life upon the patient's request/\nPreoperative Evaluation\nQuestion 1:\nA 50-year-old man with well controlled hypertension has been scheduled for surgery.

In the absence of oesophagal disease, the risk is low.\nSolution to Question 3:\nRadial artery is the preferred artery for invasive blood pressure monitoring because of ease of cannulation, presence of collateral blood flow and less associated complications.\nBefore cannulating the radial artery, it is essential to perform a modified Allen\u2019s test in order to determine the adequacy of collateral flow to the hand.\nThe other arteries which can be used for invasive blood pressure monitoring are ulnar, brachial, axillary, and femoral arteries and less commonly dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and superficial temporal arteries.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe orange cannula (14 Gauge) has the maximum flow rate of 270 mL/min.\nSolution to Question 5:\nUlnar nerve stimulation at wrist is popularly used to assess the adequacy of neuromuscular blockade.\nNeuromuscular blockade is measured using a peripheral nerve stimulator.\nNerve\nResponse\nUlnar nerve\nContraction of adductor polli cis\nFacial nerve\nContraction of orbicularis oc uli\nPosterior tibial nerve\nContraction of flexor hallucis brevis\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe image shown above is the Swan-ganz catheter which is used for pulmonary artery catheterization.

The standard pulmonary artery catheter is 110 cm long with a 7.0 \u2013 9.0 Fr circumference.\nUses of Swan-ganz catheter:\nMeasurement of pressures in right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery\nIndirect measurement of left atrial pressure through pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\nCardiac output\nOxygen saturation- pulmonary samples to rule out left-right shunt\nMonitoring left ventricle filling pressure\nDifferentiate cardiogenic from non cardiogenic pulmonary edema\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most common complication of pulmonary artery catheterization is arrhythmias and are usually self-limiting.\nSince the occurrence of these arrhythmias is so common, it is considered as an indicator of the placement of the catheter in the corresponding cardiac chamber.\nComplications of pulmonary artery catheterization:\nCatheterization related:\nArrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation\nRight bundle branch block, complete heart block\nCatheter residence related:\nMechanical, catheter knots\nThromboembolism\nPulmonary infarction\nInfection, endocarditis\nEndocardial damage, cardiac valve injury\nPulmonary artery rupture\nPulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm\nOthers:\nMisinterpretation of data\nMisuse of equipment\nSolution to Question 8:\nLeft atrial pressure (LAP) is indirectly measured through pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\n(PCWP).\nLAP has been the gold standard for evaluating mitral stenosis and decompensated congestive heart failure.\nOption B: Swan-Ganz catheter is used for pulmonary artery catherization.\n\nOption C: Cardiac arrhythmias are the most frequent complication.\nOption D: The catheter is incorporated with thermistors that can be used to measure cardiac output, from which a multitude of hemodynamic values can be derived.\nSolution to Question 9:\nEntry into the pulmonary artery is indicated by an increase in diastolic pressure. Pulmonary artery catheterization involves the use of a Swan-Ganz catheter.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe right internal jugular vein is the most preferred vein for central venous cannulation. Reasons for preference:\nAbsence of valves\nConsistent anatomic location of the internal jugular vein\nEasily identifiable surface landmarks\nDirect communication with the right atrium. Other sites for central venous cannulation:\nSubclavian vein: greater risk of pneumothorax\nLeft internal jugular vein: greater risk of pleural effusion &amp; chylothorax\nFemoral vein: increased risk of thromboembolic complications, infection, and vascular injury.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nCapnography is a measurement of end-tidal CO2, which is used to confirm tracheal intubation and assess ventilation in the perioperative period.\nCardiac output measurements technique:\nThermodilution\nDye dilution, using indocyanine green\nLithium dilution\nPulse contour devices\nEsophageal doppler\nThoracic bioimpedance\nEchocardiography\nNote: Thermal dilution method uses a non-toxic liquid of temperature different from the blood. This fluid is injected into a vein and is detected on the arterial side using a catheter with a temperature sensor. The rate of flow of this liquid is used to calculate the cardiac output.\nSolution to Question 12:\nLead II is the best for detecting arrhythmias and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Lead V5 is th best for detecting anterior and lateral wall myocardial infarction.\nFor arrhythmia, oesophagal leads are better than lead II but they are not yet put into wide use.\nFor myocardial ischemia, new regional wall motion abnormalities and decreased systolic wall thickening on transesophageal echocardiography are more sensitive than ECG.\nSolution to Question 13:\nTransesophageal echocardiography is the most sensitive indicator of myocardial ischemia.\nNew regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and decreased systolic wall thickening on transesophageal echocardiography are more sensitive than ECG.\nIschemia may be indicated clinically by a sudden onset intraoperative arrhythmia or conduction block.\nSolution to Question 14:\nAmong the given investigations, dobutamine stress echocardiography provides the most accurate prognostic information with respect to predicting risks of perioperative cardiac complications.\nPreoperative cardiac stress testing can help identify the presence and severity of preexisting CAD. The prognostic performance of these tests is better assessed based on positive and negative likelihood ratios. Among all the given options, dobutamine stress echocardiography has the maximum positive likelihood ratio and hence provides the most accurate prognostic information.\nEven though coronary angiography is considered the gold standard, it may not absolutely risk-stratify patients because many perioperative cardiac events may be related to noncritical coronary lesions.\nSolution to Question 15:\nCapnography is not considered as it cannot be used to monitor the depth of anaesthesia.\nCapnography is a quantitative measure of end-tidal carbon dioxide that is used to assess ventilation in the perioperative period and confirm the correct placement of an endotracheal tube.\nMonitors used to assess the depth of anaesthesia:\nElectroencephalography (EEG)\nBispectral index (BIS)\nEntropy\nEvoked responses (EP) - Motor EP, sensory EP (Auditory, visual, brain stem evoked potential)\nPatient state index\nNarcotrend.\nSolution to Question 16:\nBeta waves on EEG signify light anesthesia.\nBeta waves on EEG are seen in awake state and during initial stages of inhalational anesthesia.\nEEG wave s\nFreque ncy\nDepth of anesthesia\nAlpha",

It is useful in patients already on Swan-Ganz catheter.\nOption A: Oral cavity (sublingual) readings can be influenced by mouth breathing, tachypnea, and ambient temperature.\nOption C: Axilla readings are influenced by contact with probe, skin perfusion, environment, etc. Option D: Rectum readings are higher than central sites due to heat-producing flora in feces.\nOther sites for core thermal monitoring:\nTympanic membrane\nNasopharynx\nTrachea\nSkin\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe tympanic membrane measures the brain temperature most accurately.\nThe tympanic membrane and the hypothalamus share a common blood supply. Hence, measuring the temperature at this site reflects thermal information at the primary site of thermoregulation.\nDisadvantages are trauma during insertion and cerumen insulation, so it is not routinely used.\nSolution to Question 23:\nSweating is the best preserved thermoregulatory mechanism during anesthesia.\nOption A and C: General anesthetics decrease the thresholds (triggering core temperatures) for vasoconstriction and shivering by 2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C.\nOption D: Nonshivering thermogenesis does not occur in anesthetized patients.\nSolution to Question 24:\nAllen's Test is used to test the adequacy of collateral blood flow to the hand.

This is achieved by drawing 0.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the syringe is sufficient for the procedure.\nHeparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.0, and the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter ABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains in the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG determination.\nNote:\nModified Allen's test positive indicates that the collateral blood flow is normal\nModified Allen's test negative indicates that the collateral blood flow is abnormal and an alternate site must be chosen.\n\nRespiratory Monitoring in Anaesthesia\nQuestion 1:\nIn a patient who is scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which of the following cannot be used for perioperative respiratory monitoring?\nCapnography\nPulse oximetry\nRadial artery cannulation\nImpedance pneumography\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following is measured by the device shown in the given image?\n\nOxygen saturation\nOxygen content of the blood\nPartial pressure of oxygen\nAmount of inspired oxygen\nQuestion 3:\nWhile examining a patient you record low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry.

Pulse oximetry is used for monitoring pulse rate and oxygen saturation of a patient.\nA small sensor is placed on the finger, toe, earlobe, or another convenient place. The relative absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin is assessed by measuring the amount of red and infrared light emerging from tissues traversed by light rays and processed by the device, producing an oxygen saturation level.\nPulse oximetry does not measure the absolute content or the partial pressures of oxygen or carbon dioxide.\nA pulse oximeter is not always reliable as it reads:\nFalsely high - carboxyhemoglobinemia\nFalsely low - severe anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, increased systemic vascular resistance",

    "question_text": "% to 85%, irrespective of the arterial oxygen saturation - methemoglobinemia\nSolution to Question 3:\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is associated with a falsely high O2 saturation and least likely to show low oxygen saturation values.\nOxyhemoglobin (HbO2) absorbs more infrared light (940 nm)\nDeoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light (660 nm)\nCarboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and HbO2 absorption spectrum is similar\nThus in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, a falsely high SpO2 of 95% is seen irrespective of the actual SpO2 value.\nSevere anemia, low cardiac output states, hypovolemia, and increased systemic vascular resistance are associated with falsely low oxygen saturation values.\nWith normal SaO2, anemia has little effect on SpO2. However, in the presence of hypoxia, SpO2 readings underestimate SaO2 in anemic patients.\nSolution to Question 4:\nCO-oximeter is the best device to detect abnormal hemoglobins.\nCO-oximeter utilizes an eight wavelength sensor (unlike pulse oximeter which uses two wavelengths) to distinguish between oxygenated blood, deoxygenated blood and blood containing CO.\nCO-oximeter is useful in measuring:\nCarboxyhemoglobin\nMethemoglobin\nSolution to Question 5:\nEnd-tidal CO2 measured by capnography is the surest sign of tracheal intubation.\nIt also assesses the adequacy of ventilation in the perioperative period. It can rule out oesophagal intubation where initially carbon dioxide may be detected due to swallowed air but later on ceases.\nIt cannot reliably rule out endobronchial intubation, which is indicated by a sudden rise in peak inspiratory pressure.\nOption C: Physical examination methods such as auscultation of chest and epigastrium, visualization of thoracic movement, and fogging in the tube are not sufficiently reliable to confirm endotracheal tube placement.\nOptions A and D: Similarly, pulse oximetry and chest radiography are not reliable as sole techniques to determine endotracheal intubation.\nSolution to Question 6:\nCapnography is ideal for monitoring apnea in an intubated patient.\nImpedence pulmonometry is most commonly used for apnea monitoring in a non-intubated patient and is also used in home monitoring of neonatal apnea.\nPulse oximetry and CO-oximetry is used to assess oxygenation.\nSolution to Question 7:\nCapnography is used to measure the amount of expired carbon dioxide (end tidal CO2).\nIt is used to confirm tracheal intubation and to assess the adequacy of ventilation in the perioperative period.\nArterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2) is accurately measured using arterial blood gas analysis. The gradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2 (normally 2\u20135 mm Hg) reflects alveolar dead space (alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused).\nAlthough EtCO2 reflects arterial carbon dioxide level (PaCO2), any significant reduction in lung perfusion (eg, air embolism, decreased cardiac output) increases alveolar dead space, thus increasing the gradient between PaCO2 and EtCO2. Hence D is the best answer.\nSolution to Question 8:\nIn a capnographic waveform, the plateau phase corresponds to alveolar air. The normal waveform has four different phases:\nPhase I: Inspiratory baseline, represents the CO2-free gas from the airways (anatomical and apparatus dead space).\nPhase II: Expiratory upstroke, mixing of dead space gas with alveolar gas.\nPhase III: Alveolar plateau, represents CO2-rich gas from the alveoli. The last of the alveolar gas is sampled to measure ETCO2.\nPhase 0: Inspiratory downstroke and the beginning of inspiration. Alpha angle: The transition from phase II to III.\nThe alpha angle can be used to assess the ventilation/perfusion of the lung. V/Q mismatches will have an alpha angle greater than 90 degrees.\nBeta angle: The transition from phase III to 0.\nThe beta angle can be used to assess rebreathing. If rebreathing occurs, the angle is greater than 90 degrees.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nFall in ETCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) is seen in cardiac arrest due to decreased blood flow to the lungs.\nIncreased ETCO2 is seen in thyrotoxicosis, fever (increased CO2 production) and high spinal anesthesia (alveolar hypoventilation).\nFactors affecting ETCO2\nIncreased ETCO2\nDecreased ETCO2\nMetabolismHyperthermiaFev erThyrotoxicosisPainShiverin g\nMetabolismHypothermiaMet abolic acidosis\nRespiratoryHypoventilationR espiratory depressionCOPDP artial airway obstructionRebr eathing\nRespiratoryHyperventilation Total airway obstructionExtu bation\nCirculatoryIncreased cardiac output (ROSC after cardiac a rrest)Hypertension\nCirculatoryHypotensionCardi ac arrestPulmonary emboli\nIncreased ETCO2\nDecreased ETCO2\nApparatus malfunctionExhau\nApparatus malfunctionCircui\nsted CO2absorberInadequate\nt disconnectionLeak in sampl\nfresh gas flowVentilatory ma\ningVentilatory malfunction\nlfunction\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe above capnographic waveform depicts bronchospasm.\nShark fin appearance - Prolonged phase II, increased \uf0b0 angle, and steeper phase III suggest bronchospasm or airway obstruction.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe above capnographic waveform shows an elevated inspiratory baseline, which depicts rebreathing.\nRebreathing of CO2 may occur due to exhausted soda lime or incompetent expiratory valve in closed-circuit breathing systems.\nOption A: Malignant hyperthermia shows progressive rise in ETCO2 Option B: Bronchospasm shows a shark fin appearance\nOption D: Accidental extubation shows flat ETCO2 trace\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe image given in the question shows a capnograph with some carbon dioxide detected initially followed by absence of carbon dioxide- this is typical of esophageal intubation.\nSwallowed air in the stomach would cause the initial detection of CO2 which is soon washed out and the ETCO2 comes to zero.\nOption A: Malignant hyperthermia \u2013 progressive rise in CO2. Option C: Rebreathing of CO2 - elevated inspiratory baseline. Option D: Tracheal intubation - normal capnograph.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe clinical features seen in the patient, associated with a capnograph with a sudden and progressive increase in ETCO2 are suggestive of malignant hyperthermia.\nThis is considered to be one of the earliest and most sensitive indicators of malignant hyperthermia.\nOption B: Rebreathing of CO2 would result in failure of the inspired CO2 to return to zero in the capnograph.\nOption C: Tracheal intubation would show a normal capnograph.\nOption D: Esophageal intubation would initially detect some CO2 because of swallowed air in the stomach which later returns to zero.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe image shown is that of normal capnography seen during controlled mechanical ventilation seen in tracheal intubation.\nOption B: Malignant hyperthermia shows a progressive rise in CO2. Option C: Rebreathing of CO2 shows an elevated inspiratory baseline.\nOption D: Esophageal intubation can initially detect some CO2 which later returns to zero.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe curare notch in the plateau phase of the capnograph indicates that the patient is trying to breathe spontaneously. The patient's inspiratory effort causes some fresh gas to be sucked in the capnometer, resulting in a lower carbon dioxide concentration and a notch.\nImage below shows a capnograph with clefts during phase III which indicates spontaneous breathing efforts by the patient during controlled mechanical ventilation. It is also known as a curare notch or cleft.\n\nAirway Devices\nQuestion 1:\nYou are a certified BLS provider showing your junior how to perform bag and mask ventilation on a mannequin.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe fifth digit of the hand should be placed at the angle of mandible while holding a face mask.\n\nOne hand technique: C-E technique\nThe anesthetist holds the mask in his left hand using C-E technique. C is formed by the thumb and the index finger, and E is formed by the remaining 3 fingers.\nThe thumb and index fingers form a C around the collar of the connector\nThe third and fourth digits are placed on the body of the mandible\nThe fifth digit is placed on the angle of the mandible\nThe thumb and index finger ensure a tight mask seal, while the remaining digits provide jaw thrust to aid with airway patency.\nSolution to Question 2:\nBag and mask ventilation can be performed in patients with difficult airway.\nBag and mask ventilation serves as a rescue technique to provide oxygenation and ventilation in patients with difficult airway until tracheal intubation is achieved.\nContraindications of bag and mask ventilation:\nPatients at greater risk of aspiration such as patients with diaphragmatic hernia and those undergoing rapid sequence induction and intubation. This is because air can enter the stomach leading to raised intragastric pressure which increases the risk of aspiration.\nMask ventilation should also be performed with caution in patients with severe facial trauma and in patients in whom head and neck manipulation must be avoided (e.g., those with an unstable cervical spine fracture).\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe image shows oropharyngeal airway or Guedel airway of various sizes. The landmarks used for measuring the appropriate size of this device are the corner of the mouth and the angle of\nthe mandible or tragus.\n\nAn oropharyngeal airway is an airway adjunct which keeps the tongue from falling back onto the posterior pharynx.\nIt is essential to choose the correct size since inappropriately sized ones may aggravate airway obstruction.\nThese airways should not be used in conscious patients as they may come into contact with the epiglottis and base of tongue. This can cause coughing, retching or laryngospasm if the pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are not blunted with local anaesthetic.\nNote: Nasopharyngeal airway size is chosen by measuring the distance between the tip of the nose and tragus of the ear. These airways, when well lubricated and inserted with proper technique, can be used in conscious patients to secure an airway.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe image shows nasopharyngeal airway and its insertion. The true statement is that it is used to prevent falling back of tongue post-extubation especially in obese patients.\nNasopharyngeal airways are less stimulating than oropharyngeal airways as it bypasses the gag reflex. Thus, it can be used in conscious patients as well.\nIt does not prevent tongue bite unlike the oropharyngeal airway which has a bite block. It can prevent falling back of the tongue in patients with seizures.\nIt is contraindicated in\nBasilar skull fractures, central facial fractures, CSF rhinorrhea - risk of meningitis\nPatients on anticoagulants, coagulopathies, epistaxis - risk of bleeding\nRelatively contraindicated in pregnancy (increased vascularity leading to bleeding), deformity of the nose.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe image shown above is the technique of insertion of laryngeal mask airway.\nLaryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that is positioned in the hypopharynx.\n\nClassic Laryngeal Mask Airway\nSupraglottic airway devices are used with both spontaneously and ventilated patients during anesthesia.\nLMA has advantages of being used in many settings, including the operating room (alternate route of ventilation), the emergency department (difficult intubation), and out-of-hospital care (paramedics).\nThis is because it is easy to use, quick to place even for the inexperienced provider and has a very high success rate.\nThe technique of insertion:\nThe deflated cuff of LMA is lubricated and inserted blindly into the hypopharynx so that, once nflated, the cuff forms a low-pressure seal around the entrance to the larynx.\nCorrect placement of the tube is confirmed by giving gentle positive pressure ventilation while checking for chest rise and ETCO2 using capnography.\n\nNote:\nOropharyngeal airway: inserted in the patient\u2019s mouth with concavity towards hard palate. As the airway is inserted it is rotated 180 degrees (concavity towards the tongue) until the flange comes to rest on the patient\u2019s lips.\n\nNasopharyngeal airway: inserted through the nostril (after lubrication) along the natural curvature of the floor of the nasal cavity with the bevel pointing towards the septum. Once the device is inserted the flange should rest on the nostril opening.\nEndotracheal tube: inserted infraglottically after visualising the vocal cords with direct laryngoscopy.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe appropriate size of laryngeal mask airway for a man weighing 75 kg is 5.\nLaryngeal mask airway is a supraglottic airway device, which is placed in the hypopharynx and protects the larynx from pharyngeal secretions.\nSolution to Question 7:\nLaryngeal mask airway of size 3 would be most appropriate for individuals weighing about 30 kgs.\nSolution to Question 8:\nLaryngeal mask airway (LMA) is indicated in cases with difficult airway where endotracheal intubation is not possible or not available. It can be used as an alternative to an endotracheal tube for ventilating and oxygenating the patient.\nLMA is relatively contraindicated in conditions that are associated with increased risk of aspiration (e.g.: Hiatal hernia, pregnancy, inadequate NPO). LMA may protect the larynx from pharyngeal secretions but not from gastric secretions. The presence of a pharyngeal pathology such as an abscess or tumor, or a pharyngeal obstruction is also a relative contraindication of LMA insertion.\nThe normal anatomic position of the LMA.\nThe proximal portion of the LMA rests upon the epiglottis, whereas the distal end or, the tip extends into the pharynx at the upper end of the esophagus. The opening on the laryngeal mask overlies the laryngeal inlet.\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nProseal laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a re-usable second-generation supraglottic airway device, not a single-use device.\nIt also has an integrated bite block, a drainage tube to remove gastric secretions, and an improved cuff design. This reduces the risk of aspiration.\nHence it may be suitable in non-supine positions (e.g., lateral, prone), laparoscopic surgery (e.g.,\ncholecystectomy, gynaecological surgery), and in patients who are obese.\n\nAll these features are also present in LMA Supreme, except that it is a single-use second generation supraglottic device.\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe image shown above is the Fastrach laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or intubating LMA with an endotracheal tube within its lumen.\nIt has a distinct advantage over other LMA designs as it can facilitate endotracheal intubation through the LMA device.\nIt has a rigid handle and an epiglottis elevator.\n\nLMA Proseal and LMA Supreme are second-generation LMA devices that have integrated bite blocks, an orogastric tube to remove gastric secretions, and an improved cuff design.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThere is an increased risk of aspiration of gastric contents with laryngeal mask airway.\nThe laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that sits in the hypopharynx and partially protects the larynx from pharyngeal secretions, but not gastric regurgitation.\nAdvantages:\nEasy and rapid\nLess invasive\nBetter hemodynamic stability\nVery useful in difficult intubations\nLess tooth and laryngeal trauma\nDoes not require muscle relaxation\nDoes not require neck mobility Disadvantages:\nIncreased risk of gastrointestinal aspiration\nLess safe in prone or jack-knife positions\nLess secure airway\nGreater risk of gas leak and pollution\nCan cause gastric distention\nSolution to Question 12:\nSore throat is the most common symptom following the use of a laryngeal mask airway with an incidence of 10-20%.\nInjury to the lingual, hypoglossal, and recurrent laryngeal nerves are rare.\nThese complications can be minimized by using an adequate sized device and avoiding high cuff pressures.\nIntubation\nQuestion 1:\nIn what position would you place a patient prior to direct laryngoscopy?\nCervical flexion with atlanto-occipital flexion\nCervical extension with atlanto-occipital extension\nCervical flexion with atlanto-occipital extension\nCervical extension with atlanto-occipital flexion\nQuestion 2:\nYou are the 2nd year Anaesthesia PG on call. You are paged to the COVID ICU. A 50 year old patient who was on non-invasive ventilation is desaturating rapidly. The anaesthetist instructs you to intubate the patient with an endotracheal tube. What is the most commonly used laryngoscopic blade for this procedure?\nMiller\nMacintosh\nWisconsin\nMagill\nQuestion 3:\nSara, a 6 year old child, was brought to the ER by her parents with a history of fever, cough, and body pain for the past 3 days. On examination, she was lethargic and had difficulty in breathing. She was desaturating despite trying non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.\nWhat is the most appropriate next step of management in this scenario?\nIntubation using Miller's blade\nNeedle cricothyrotomy\nIntubation using Macintosh blade\nPercutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation\nQuestion 4:\nIn which of the following devices is Murphy's eye seen?\nNasopharyngeal airway\nLaryngoscope\nBronchoscope\nEndotracheal tube\nQuestion 5:\nAppropriate sized endotracheal tube for an adult is \t.",

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nPrior to direct laryngoscopy and intubation, the patient is placed in the sniffing position, which consists of flexion at the lower cervical spine with extension at the atlanto-occipital joint.\nThis is to ensure a line of sight from the mouth to the larynx so that intubation can be performed with ease.\nCervical flexion of 35 degrees is provided by elevating the patient's head by 7-9 cm (folded sheet under the head). This aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes.\nAtlanto-occipital extension is provided by the head tilt. This brings into alignment the visual axis of the mouth with that of pharyngeal and laryngeal axes.\nAdequacy of head elevation can be estimated by checking the horizontal alignment between external auditory meatus and sternal notch.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe most commonly used laryngoscopic blade for endotracheal intubation in adults is Macintosh. Laryngoscopic blades can be:\nMacintosh - curved laryngoscopic blade. It is preferred for use in adults.\nMiller - straight laryngoscopic blade. It is used in\nNeonates, infants and young children\nAdults with short thyromental distance and long floppy epiglottis.\nThe advantage of a curved Macintosh blade is that there would be greater room available for the passage for an endotracheal tube and significantly less damage to the teeth.\n\nMacintosh laryngoscopic blade\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe next step of management in this scenario would be attempting to secure the airway by endotracheal intubation. The most commonly used laryngoscopic blade for endotracheal intubation in infants and young children is Miller's laryngoscopic blade.\nMacintosh laryngoscopic blade is preferred in adults. Needle cricothyrotomy and percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation are invasive airway accesses and are only performed when intubation fails.\n\nMiller's laryngoscopic blade\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nMurphy's eye is seen in the endotracheal tube (ETT).\nMurphy's eye refers to the distal opening in the side wall of the ETT.\nIf the distal end of the lumen of the tube is blocked by secretions, Murphy's eye serves to provide an alternate route for ventilation.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nAppropriate sized endotracheal tube for an adult is 7.5 mm.\nSize of an endotracheal tube usually refers to the internal diameter in mm. Usually a 7-7.5 mm is used for women and an 7.5-9 mm ETT is used for men.\nSolution to Question 6:\nAppropriate size of an endotracheal tube for a \u2019 year old child is 5mm. Size of an endotracheal tube usually refers to the internal diameter in mm.\nAccording to the Penlington formula, size of the endotracheal tube in the pediatric population is calculated by:\n&lt;6 years: 3.75 + [Age/3] &gt;6 years: \u2019.5 + [Age/\u2019]\nThe appropriate size of the endotracheal tube for this child is 5 mm ( 3.75 + [\u2019/3] ) = 3.75 + 1.33 =",

    "question_text": "2\u2019\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe appropriate length of the endotracheal tube for a 6-year-old child is 15 cm.\nThe formula to estimate endotracheal tube length is: 12 + (Age/2) = Length of tube (in cm)\nIf the ETT is inserted too deep, it can lead to endobronchial intubation. If inserted too shallow, it can lead to accidental extubation.\nAn adequate sized tube should be placed with its tip midway between the vocal cords and the carina.\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe advantage of an armored endotracheal tube is less kinking.\nArmored tubes (a.k.a. reinforced tubes, flexo-metallic tubes) are flexible, spiral wound tubes that are reinforced with metal coils. This minimizes kinking of the tube.\nThey are useful in surgeries of head and neck and surgeries performed with the patient in the prone position.\nArmored or Flexo-metallic endotracheal tube:\n\nOther specialized endotracheal tubes include:\nMicrolaryngeal tubes: have smaller internal diameters and longer lengths which makes them useful for laryngeal surgeries.\nMetal tubes: are LASER resistant and are used for laser airway surgery to reduce fire hazards.\nDouble-lumen tubes: have two lumens (tracheal and bronchial) to facilitate lung isolation and one-lung ventilation in thoracic surgeries.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe device shown in the image is the south oral Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) endotracheal tube.\nIt is preferred for nasal and ophthalmic surgeries because it has a preformed right-angle bend at the level of the teeth so that it does not disrupt the surgical field.\nThe image below shows south faced oral RAE tube used for surgery.\n\nThe image below shows a north nasal RAE tube.\nIt is preferred in oral surgeries as the tube connector faces towards the patient's head after placement, and the surgical field is not disrupted.\n\nOther specialized endotracheal tubes and their uses:\nFlexometalllic (Armored or reinforced tubes): head and neck surgery\nMicrolaryngeal tubes: laryngeal surgery\nDouble-lumen endotracheal tubes: thoracic surgery\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe most preferred type of cuff of an endotracheal tube is high volume, low pressure.\nAdvantage of high-volume, low-pressure cuff is lesser incidence of tracheal mucosal damage. Disadvantages of high-volume, low-pressure cuff include:\nSore throat (due to larger mucosal contact area)\nAspiration\nSpontaneous extubation\nDifficulty in insertion (because of the floppy cuff)\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nCuff pressure should not exceed 25 cm of H2O since excess cuff pressure can lead to tracheal mucosal injury and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.\nCuff should be inflated to the minimum volume at which no air leak is seen.\nIf nitrous oxide is used in general anesthesia, then cuff pressure should be monitored periodically as nitrous oxide can diffuse into the cuff causing the cuff pressure to rise.\nSolution to Question 12:\nNasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in base of skull fractures as there is a chance for the tube to enter the cranial vault.\nThe nasotracheal route is preferred in the following:\nWhen intubation via the oral route is difficult or not possible - large oral cavity tumors or abscess, conditions restricting mouth opening like temporomandibular joint ankylosis, fracture mandible etc.\nSurgeries of the oral cavity\nAwake intubation as it bypasses the gag reflex and is more tolerable by a conscious patient.\nSolution to Question 13:\nDetection of end-tidal CO2 but dropping oxygen saturation with absent breath sounds over the left hemithorax points to endobronchial intubation into the right main bronchus.\nSigns of endobronchial intubation:\nElevated peak inspiratory pressure (first sign)\nAsymmetric chest expansion\nUnilateral breath sound\nDrop in oxygen saturation\nCapnography and detection of end-tidal CO2, though the surest confirmation for an advanced airway placement, does not differentiate endotracheal from endobronchial intubation.\nEsophageal intubation: initial end-tidal CO2 may be detected due to swallowed air but later becomes zero. There would be the absence of breath sounds bilaterally with the presence of breath sounds in the epigastrium.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nEndotracheal intubation cannot be performed in this patient due to complete upper airway obstruction.\nContraindications of endotracheal intubation:\nSevere airway obstruction or trauma (critical airway obstruction).\nFractures of the jaw or skull.\nPresence of a laryngeal tumour. Note :\nIn this case, invasive airways such as needle cricothyrotomy and percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation are preferred to secure the airway when the obstruction is above the level of the vocal\ncords.\nIf the obstruction is either partial or more distal to the vocal cords, intubation can be attempted to secure the airway. This pushes the foreign body towards one of the bronchi such that there is ventilation from the unobstructed opposite side. Then the foreign body can be extracted by endoscopic removal.\nSolution to Question 15:\nBag and mask ventilation is avoided in rapid sequence intubation because it leads to stomach inflation and increases the risk of aspiration.\nIndications of Rapid sequence intubation:\nRSI is done when the patient is at increased risk of pulmonary aspiration as in:\npregnancy\nfull stomach\nintestinal obstruction\nhiatus hernia\nencephalopathy\nmorbid obesity\ndiabetic gastroparesis.\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nPreoxygenation with tidal volume breathing of 3 mins is required before tracheal intubation. Preoxygenation or denitrogenation is the process of replacing nitrogen in the lungs with oxygen.\nThis delays the onset of critical hypoxia during the period of apnea by 5-8 minutes.\nThis lengthened apnea time provides an improved margin of safety while the anesthesiologist secures the airway and resumes ventilation.\nSolution to Question 17:\nRapid sequence intubation for a patient with a hiatus hernia should be facilitated by the use of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant such as rocuronium, to prevent an increase in the intragastric pressure (IGP).\nSuccinylcholine is usually the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI since it has a rapid onset and short duration of action. However, regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents are likely, due to fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscles. Hence, endotracheal intubation may be facilitated with rocuronium before succinylcholine to decrease this risk.\nGenerally, an IGP &gt; 28 cm H2O is required to overcome the competence of the gastroesophageal junction. However, when the normal oblique angle of entry of the esophagus into the stomach is altered, the IGP required for regurgitation is much lesser.\nConditions that predispose to raised IGP are:\nPregnancy\nAscite\nBowel obstruction\nHiatus hernia\nSolution to Question 18:\nLidocaine is the local anesthetic of choice to provide topical anesthesia of airway prior to awake intubation. It is preferred since it has a rapid onset and a high therapeutic index.\nBupivacaine is not formulated for topical use.\nBenzocaine and Cetacaine (a topical application spray containing benzocaine, tetracaine, and butamben) had been used but greater incidence of methemoglobinemia due to benzocaine has discouraged their use.\nPrilocaine is usually available as a combination with lidocaine in Eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) to provide topical anesthesia to intact skin.\nSolution to Question 19:\nNowadays, a mixture of Lidocaine 3% and Phenylephrine 0.25% is most commonly used in awake nasotracheal intubation. This is used in addition to conscious sedation with low doses of midazolam and fentanyl. Phenylephrine is added to this mixture due to its vasoconstrictive\nproperty.\nOption A : Topical cocaine has vasoconstricting properties and hence is ideal for anesthesia of the nasal mucosa during awake nasotracheal intubation. However, its use has been discouraged due to toxicity and abuse potential.\nOption C : Benzocaine and Cetacaine (a topical application spray containing benzocaine, tetracaine, and butamben) was previously used but a greater incidence of methemoglobinemia due to benzocaine has discouraged its use.\nOption D : Bupivacaine is not formulated for topical use.\nSolution to Question 20:\nGlycopyrrolate is used as a pre-anesthetic agent for reducing the secretions.\nAnticholinergic drugs e.g. atropine, glycopyrrolate are routinely administered with anticholinesterases in order to attenuate the undesirable muscarinic effects. Glycopyrrolate is usually preferred because it has less vagolytic effects than atropine at doses that inhibit secretions and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. It should be administered as early as possible to maximize its effectiveness.\nGlycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, is administered to dry airway secretions before flexible scope intubation of the trachea, during the bronchoscopic examination.\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe image shows a tray in an airway cart with the instruments necessary for airway management. An airway cart may include:\nLaryngoscope blades of various sizes, including a rigid fibreoptic.\nTracheal tubes of various sizes, and tracheal tube guides such as semirigid stylets, ventilating tube changer, light wands, and forceps that are required to manipulate the distal portion of the tracheal tube.\nMasks of various sizes.\nLaryngeal mask airways of various sizes.\nFlexible fiberoptic intubation equipment.\nRetrograde intubation equipment.\nAt least one device to perform emergency noninvasive airway ventilation such as esophageal tracheal tube, a hollow jet ventilation stylet.\nEquipment required for emergency invasive airway access.\nAn exhaled CO2 detector.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe image shown is of an armored tube (a.k.a. reinforced, flexo-metallic endotracheal tube). It is useful in head and neck surgeries and when the patient is in a prone position.\nAn armored tube is a flexible, spiral wound tube which is reinforced with the metal coil so as to minimize kinking. The metal coil is better made out in the second image.\nOther specialized endotracheal tubes include:\nSouth oral Ring Adair Elwin: Nasal surgery\nMicro laryngeal tubes: Laryngeal surgery\nDouble-lumen endotracheal tubes (Carlen, Robertshaw): Thoracic surgery\nNote: The tip of the armored endotracheal tube is 2 cm distal to the distal-most metal ring, and this portion may not be visualized in radiography.\nSolution to Question 23:\nSudden rise in peak inspiratory pressure is an indicator of endobronchial intubation. Signs of endobronchial intubation:\nElevated peak inspiratory pressure (first sign)\nAsymmetric chest expansion\nUnilateral breath sound\nHypoxemia\nBreathing Systems\nQuestion 1:\nOn your first day in the operation theater, you notice the following machine. What type of machine is this?\n\nContinuous flow machine\nIntermittent flow machine\nIntermittent at low flows and continuous at high flow\nContinuous at low flows and intermittent at high flow\nQuestion 2:\nWhat is the most commonly used Mapleson circuit?\nType B\nType A\nType F\nType D\nQuestion 3:\nWhich of the following is not a co-axial circuit?\nJackson Ree\nLack\nBain\nPenlon\nQuestion 4:\nYou observe the following breathing circuit being used to ventilate a brain-dead patient who is being shifted to the OT for organ procurement. Which type of Mapleson circuit does this belong to?\n\nMapleson A\nMapleson B\nMapleson C\nMapleson D\nQuestion 5:\nWhich of the following components is not seen in a Bain circuit?\nFresh gas inlet\nReservoir bag\nCarbon dioxide absorber\nPressure limiting valve\nQuestion 6:\nIdentify the device shown below:\n\nMagill's circuit\nLack's circuit\nBain's circuit\nJackson and Rees' circuit\nQuestion 7:\nYou are an anaesthesia resident posted in the pediatrics OT. A spontaneously breathing 6 year old child is set to undergo a minor elective procedure. Which of the following circuits would be the best choice for ventilating this patient?\nMagill's circuit\nAyre's T piece\nWater's to and fro circuit\nJackson Rees circuit\nQuestion 8:\nWhat is the type of circuit shown in the image?\n\nMapleson E\nMapleson C\nMapleson B\nMapleson F\nQuestion 9:\nWhat is the most effective circuit for anaesthesia under spontaneous breathing?\nMapleson A\nMapleson B\nMapleson C\nMapleson D\nQuestion 10:\nA 25-year-old athlete with left apical primary spontaneous pneumothorax was posted for thoracoscopic bullectomy under anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation. Which of the following breathing circuits would be the most effective for this purpose?\nMapleson A\nMapleson B\nMapleson C\nMapleson D\nQuestion 11:\nFor a patient with respiratory failure requiring controlled ventilation, which of the following is true about the order of efficiency of Mapleson circuits?\nD&gt;E&gt;F&gt;A\nA&gt;D=F&gt;C\nD=F&gt;B&gt;A\nA&gt;B=C&gt;D\nQuestion 12:\nDuring an elective operation, you observe the following breathing circuit is used to provide anaesthesia. Which of the following is not true regarding this system?\n\nUnidirectional gas flow\nRebreathing of anaesthetic gase\nIncreased air pollution\nRemoval of carbon dioxide\nQuestion 13:\nA surgeon was performing a procedure that was going on for more time than predicted. Suddenly the automatic ventilation and scavenger systems failed. What is the maximum safety limit for the concentration of nitrous oxide in the OR after which adverse health effects may develop in those exposed?",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe machine shown in the image is Boyle's machine. It is a type of continuous flow machine. Types of anesthesia machine:\nContinuous flow: Gas flows during both inspiration and expiration\nBoyle's apparatu\nForegger\nHeidbrink\nIntermittent flow: Gas flows only during inspiration\nEntonox apparatu\nMcKesson's apparatu\nBoyle's machine was invented by Henry Edmund Gaskin Boyle in 1917. Although a lot of changes have been made for the original Boyle's apparatus, the basic structure of anesthesia workstation still remains the same.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe most commonly used Mapleson circuit system is Mapleson circuit type D. Mapleson classified the semi-closed anesthetic breathing system according to\nThe position of the expiratory valve\nThe fresh gas flow inlet\nPosition/presence of the reservoir bag\nMapleson's system includes Type A, B, C, D, E, and F.\nMapleson circuit type D is the circuit of choice for controlled ventilation.\nNote: The Bain circuit is a coaxial version of the Mapleson D system that incorporates the fresh gas inlet tubing inside the breathing tube. Bain circuit, unlike Mapleson D, can also be used for pontaneous ventilation.\n\nSchimmelbusch mask used for open drop method of anesthesia\n\nClosed or Circle system\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nJackson Rees circuit (Mapleson F) is not a co-axial circuit. It is a modification of Ayre's T piece. Co-axial circuits have two tubings, one inner and one outer tubing (arranged co-axially).\nExamples of co-axial circuits:\nLack's circuit: co-axial modification of Mapleson A\nBain's circuit: co-axial modification of Mapleson D\nPenlon circuit: co-axial modification of Mapleson D or modification of Bain's circuit\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given circuit is the Bain's circuit which is a coaxial modification of the Mapleson D circuit. Co-axial circuits have two tubings, one inner and one outer tubing (arranged co-axially).\nBain's circuit has\nInner inspiratory tubing: carries fresh gas flow to the patient\nOuter expiratory tubing: carries exhaled gases out through APL (adjustable pressure limiting) valve\nBain's circuit is often called a universal circuit as it can be used for adult and pediatric patients, for spontaneous and controlled ventilation.\n\nMapleson's D vs Bain's circuit\nSolution to Question 5:\nBain circuit belongs to Mapleson's semi-closed breathing system, which lacks carbon dioxide absorber.\nComponents of Mapleson's system are\nBreathing tube\nFresh gas inlet\nAdjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve\nReservoir bag\nCarbon dioxide absorber (e.g. soda lime) is a component of the closed or circle system. This allows rebreathing of anesthetic gases after the removal of exhaled carbon dioxide.\n\nClassification of breathing system\n\nBain's circuit with its components, fresh gas inlet, corrugated breathing tubes, APL valve and reservoir bag.\n\nCircle system with its components, CO2 absorber, fresh gas inlet, an inspiratory uni-directional valve and inspiratory breathing tube, a Y-connector, expiratory uni-directional valve\nand expiratory breathing tube, APL valve and reservoir bag.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe image shown above is of Lack's circuit, which is a co-axial modification of Mapleson's A circuit.\nCo-axial circuits have two tubings, one inner and one outer tubing (arranged co-axially). Lack's circuit has:\nInner expiratory tubing: carries exhaust gases out through APL valve\nOuter inspiratory tubing: carries fresh gas flow to the patient\n\n\nMagill's circuit (Mapleson A) designed by Sir Ivan Magill, best suited for spontaneous ventilation.\n\nJackson and Rees circuit (Mapleson F) is a modification of Ayre's T piece. Best suited for children under 20 kg.\nSolution to Question 7:\nJackson Rees modification of Ayre's T piece is the circuit of choice for ventilating a spontaneously breathing child during anesthesia.\nJackson Rees modification of Ayre's T piece is classified as a Mapleson's F system, although it was not included in the original description by Prof Mapleson.\nIt is used in children &lt;6 years or &lt;20 kgs.\nMapleson Circuit\nComments\nType A (Magill's circuit)\nCircuit of choice for spontane ous ventilation\nType B\nObsolete\nType C (Water's to and fro)\nObsolete\nType D (Bain's circuit)\nCircuit of choice for controlle d ventilation. Most commonl y used circuit.\nType E (Ayre's T piece)\nCircuit of 2nd choice in child ren\nType F (Jackson Rees Modifi cation)\nCircuit of choice in children\n(<20 kg)\n\nJackson Rees modification of Ayre's T piece.\nFGI - Fresh gas inlet; RB - Reservoir bag; P - Patient\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above image is Ayre's T piece, which is a type of Mapleson's E circuit.\n\nAyre's T piece\nSuitable for use in neonates and children due to low dead space and low resistance.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe most effective circuit for anesthesia under spontaneous breathing is Mapleson A or Magill's circuit.\nWhen the Mapleson A circuit is used for spontaneous ventilation, the fresh gas flow rate of the circuit is closest to the physiological minute ventilation of the patient. Hence it is preferred over other circuits.\nSolution to Question 10:\nMapleson's A or Magill circuit is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. Modified co-axial variety of Type A - Lack's circuit.\nSMAL - For Spontaneous, Magill's circuit, Mapleson's Type A, Lack's co-axial circuit\nSolution to Question 11:\nFrom the above options, the order of efficiency of Mapleson circuits in controlled ventilation is D=F&gt;B&gt;A.\nWhen the Mapleson D circuit is used for controlled ventilation, the fresh gas flow rate of the circuit is closest to the physiological minute ventilation of the patient.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe circle system is not associated with increased air pollution.\nThe incidence of air pollution: Open&gt;Mapleson&gt;Circle system.\nThe ability to scavenge exhaled gases is also maximum with a closed system. Scavenging is the process of removal of waste anesthetic gases from both the anesthesia machine and the anesthetizing location (operation theatre). Thus minimizing operating room pollution.\nComponents of the circle system:\nCO2 absorber\nfresh gas inlet\nuni-directional valves (inspiratory and expiratory)\nBreathing tubes (inspiratory and expiratory)\nY-connector\nAPL valve\nReservoir bag.\nThe circle system allows for a uni-directional flow of anesthetic gases.\nCarbon dioxide absorber (eg soda-lime) allows rebreathing of anesthetic gases after the removal of exhaled carbon dioxide. This conserves anesthetic gases and thus reduces air pollution.\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nMaximum safety limit for the concentration of nitrous oxide in the operating room environment is 25 ppm and for the halogenated anesthetic is 2 ppm.\nNational institute for occupational safety and health (NIOSH) guidelines:\nAnesthetic Gas\nMaximum Concentration (\nppm)\nHalogenated agent alo ne",

It is a part of the low-pressure system.\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nSoda lime is the most commonly used carbon dioxide absorbent in circle breathing systems.\nSolution to Question 3:\n100 gm of Soda lime absorbs 23 L of carbon dioxide.\nSoda lime is the most commonly used carbon dioxide absorbent in circle breathing systems.\nSolution to Question 4:\nStatement 1: 100 g of sodalime can absorb 23 liters of CO2\nStatement 2: The end product of the reaction of soda lime with CO2 is CaCO3+NaOH. Reaction end products include heat (the heat of neutralization), water, calcium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide.\nIts reactions are as follows:\nCO2 + H2O \uf0ae H2CO3\nH2CO3 + 2NaOH \uf0ae Na2CO3 + 2H2O + Heat (a fast reaction)\nNa2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 \uf0ae CaCO3 + 2NaOH + Heat (a slow reaction)\nNote that the water and sodium hydroxide initially required are regenerated. Statement 3: The major constituent of soda lime is Ca(OH)2 - 80% Statement 4: Water content of sodalime is 15%\nStatement 5: KOH is one of the components of sodalime - 2%\nSolution to Question 5:\nWhen carbon dioxide absorbing capacity of soda lime using ethyl violet indicator is exhausted, the color changes from white to purple.\nSoda lime indicator dye\nIndicator\nColor when Fr esh\nColor when Exhaus ted\nEthyl violet\nWhite\nPurple\nPhenolphthal ein\nColorless\nPink\nClayton yello w\nRed\nYellow\nIndicator\nColor when Fr esh\nColor when Exhaus ted\nEthyl orange\nOrange\nYellow\nMimosa 2\nRed\nWhite\nSolution to Question 6:\nSilica in the soda lime acts as a hardening agent.\nIn Amsorb, polyvinylpyrrolidone is used as a hardening agent.\nNaOH and KOH serve as catalysts or activators to speed up the reaction between calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide.\nEthyl violet is the most commonly used indicator dye in soda lime.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe ideal granule size of the carbon dioxide absorbent is between 4 and 8 mesh (1.5-5 mm).\nSmaller granule size favors greater area for absorption of carbon dioxide. But, it offers greater airflow resistance (caking).\nConverse is true with larger granule size - the absorptive area is less but airflow resistance is minimal (channeling).\nSo, the ideal size is to be between 4 and 8 mesh as absorptive surface area and resistance to flow are optimized.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe true statement concerning Compound A is that its formation is less common with Amsorb absorbent.\nCompound A is fluoro-methyl-2,2-difluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl) vinyl ether which is the degradation product of Sevoflurane, not desflurane.\nThe strong bases like NaOH and KOH present in absorbents (soda lime) lead to its formation. Lack of strong alkali in Amsorb makes its formation less common.\nCompound A is nephrotoxic, not neurotoxic.\nIt is seen predominantly with low flow anesthesia techniques and high absorbent temperatures.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe true statement is baralyme is less efficient than soda-lime.\nBaralyme is less efficient than soda-lime as its absorptive capacity is 9-18L of CO2/100 g while of soda lime is 23L of CO2/100 g.\nBaralyme with the composition of calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide (activator) is less caustic than soda lime.\nIt gives more reliable performance in a dry environment.\nAs compared to soda lime, baralyme has a greater tendency to produce carbon monoxide.\nSolution to Question 10:\nMRI compatible medical gas cylinders are made of aluminium, while most medical gas cylinders are constructed of molybdenum steel.\nThe cylinders are produced in various sizes designated by a capital letter code.\nSize A is the smallest.\nSize H is the largest.\nSize E is the cylinder most commonly used in anesthesia machines, for patient transport, and resuscitation, followed by Size D.\nSize J is commonly used for cylinder manifold systems for central supply.\nSolution to Question 11:\nColour of the shoulder of oxygen cylinder in India is white, and the body is black. Maximum pressure in the oxygen cylinder is around 2000 psig.\nSolution to Question 12:\nBlue cylinders are used to store nitrous oxide.\nMaximum pressure in the nitrous oxide cylinder is around 745 psig.\nCritical temperature of nitrous oxide is 36.5oC, hence it is present in liquid form at room temperature.\nSolution to Question 13:\nMaximum pressure in oxygen cylinder is 2000 psig (pounds per square inch gauge) Maximum pressure in the E-cylinders:",

    "question_text": "psig for oxygen (gaseous)\nEach cylinder is passed through a high-pressure regulator, which reduces the high pressures inside the cylinder to a lower, nearly constant pressure of 45 psig, which is suitable for use in the anesthesia machine.\nSolution to Question 14:\nNitrous oxide cylinder at 100%, 50%, and 25% volume would show 750, 750, 750 PSI (pounds per square inch) respectively.\nThis is because N2O (and CO2) are stored in the cylinder as a liquid under the pressure of 750 psi at room temperature. Hence, N2O gauge will read full as long as there is liquid in the tank. After which the pressure falls until the cylinder is exhausted.\n\nN2O pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth, and empty cylinder.\nThe contents of N2O cylinders can be accurately measured by weighing the cylinders rather than by pressure gauge.\nTo measure the content, the weight of an empty cylinder, known as Tare weight is subtracted from the actual weight of the cylinder.\n\nO2 pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth and empty cylinder.\nIn a cylinder containing a non-liquefied gas such as Oxygen, the pressure in the cylinder decreases as the contents are used. Therefore the pressure gauge can be used to measure the cylinder content.\nOxygen pressure gauge would read 2200, 1100, and 550 PSI at 100%, 50%, and 25% content respectively.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given image shows the Pin index system (3,5) of Nitrous oxide.\nPin index system (PISS) is a safety measure to prevent incorrect cylinder attachment.\nEach gas cylinder has two holes (except entonox) in its cylinder valve that fits the corresponding pins in the yoke of the anesthesia machine. The relative positioning of the pins and holes is unique for each gas which constitutes the pin index system.\nThe PISS should only be considered as partial protection because pin index failures have been reported due to bent or broken pins.\nSolution to Question 16:\nPin index system for oxygen gas is 2,5.\nPin index system (PISS) is a safety measure to prevent incorrect cylinder attachment.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe normal hospital pipeline supply pressure of all gases in India is 60 psig.\nThe hospital pipeline supply is the primary source of all gases. 2000 psig of oxygen cylinder, which is a part of the high pressure system, is regulated to 45 psig after it enters the anaesthesia workstation.\nThe regulated cylinder pressure is 45 psig which is less than that of pipeline pressure.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe Diameter Index Safety System (DISS) prevents incorrect pipeline attachment.\nDISS is a safety feature in the modern anesthesia workstation. DISS connectors have unique diameters for each type of gas to prevent wrong pipeline attachment to the wrong inlet.\n\nDiameter Index Safety system\nIncorrect cylinder attachment(not pipeline) is prevented by Pin Index Safety System. Contamination of the anesthetic environment by waste gases is prevented by Scavenging system.\nDelivery of hypoxic gases is prevented by Oxygen failure safety device (shut-off or proportionating device).\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe blue pipeline in operation theatre is for nitrous oxide. Other options:\nOxygen: White Air: Black\nVacuum/Central suction: Yellow\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe oxygen flowmeter is located downstream of the other flowmeters. This is to avoid the generation of a hypoxic mixture in the event of any air leak.\n\nIn the first two images, A and B, the nitrous oxide flowmeter is located downstream and there is a leak in the airflow tube. Through this leak, most of the oxygen passes out and mainly nitrous oxide is provided at the outlet leading to the production of a hypoxic mixture.\nBut in the other two images, C and D, the oxygen flowmeter is located downstream. Through the leak in the airflow tube, some of the nitrous oxide passes out and the remaining passes out through the outlet with the oxygen. Thus the production of a hypoxic mixture is less likely if oxygen flowmeter is placed downstream.\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe flow tubes used in rotameters are also called Thorpe tubes.\n\nKey points on Flowmeter:\nFlowmeters are part of the low-pressure anesthetic gas supply system.\nThe knobs are part of the intermediate pressure system and are textured for easy identification.\nRotameters are variable orifice (area) constant pressure flowmeter.\nThorpe tubes are made of tapered glass tube, the bottom has a smaller diameter than the top.\nThe indicator is known as bobbin or float. Rotating float indicates the flow of gas.\nThe Interior of the tube is coated with a conductive substance (gold or tin oxide) in order to reduce the effect of static electricity.\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe flow rate of oxygen in the given image is 3 L.\nThe indicator present in the Rotameter (Flow meter) is known as Bobbin or Float. The flows are read from the top end of the bobbin.\nSome rotameters have ball indicator. Here, the reading is taken from the center of the ball.\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe Heidbrink meter in boyle\u2019s machine indicates the flow of gases. Heidbrink is a type of flow meter, which was used in the past.\nSolution to Question 24:\nEnflurane vaporizers are orange in color, not green.\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe image shows a specialized vapouriser Tec 6. Because of high vapor pressure (669 mmHg at 20\u00b0C) and low boiling point (22.8\u00b0C ~ room temperature), Desflurane requires this\nspecialized vaporizer for its delivery.\nAnesthetic gas with the highest vapor pressure is Desflurane. Other salient features of Desflurane:\nHigh saturated vapor pressure which is 3-4 times the other agents\nLow boiling point\nLow blood-gas solubility (0.42) resulting in rapid uptake and recovery\nHigh MAC value of 6, indicating low potency\nRequires specialized vapouriser such as Tec 6\nColor coding of Desflurane - Blue\nUndergoes minimal metabolism\nDegraded into CO by the desiccated CO2 absorbent\nSolution to Question 26:\nThe maximum pressure allowed in an anesthesia reservoir bag is 60 cm H20.\nThe reservoir bag serves as a reservoir for inhaled excess fresh gas and helps to generate positive pressure ventilation.\nIt is most commonly placed between the expiratory unidirectional valve and the CO2 absorber. The minimum allowed pressure is 30 cm H2O.\nAnesthesia workstation\n\nSolution to Question 27:\nHeat and moisture exchanger (HME) is a passive humidifier, not active.\nThe natural humidification and conservation of heat by the upper respiratory tract is lost or bypassed after tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. HME acts as an artificial nose, which traps the exhaled water vapor and heat passively by its hygroscopic material, and thus conserves heat and adds moisture to the inhaled gases.\nActive humidifiers act by allowing air passage inside a heated water reservoir. These devices are placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air is loaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient\u2019s airway.\nSome humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission of microbes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients.\nThe disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit.\n\nShown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material.\n\nShown above is the placement of HME filter in the breathing circuit.\nSolution to Question 28:\nAbility to scavenge exhaled gases is maximum with Circle system (Circle&gt;Mapleson&gt;Open).\nScavenging is the process of removal of waste anesthetic gases from both the anesthesia machine and the anesthetizing location (operation theatre), thus minimizing operating room pollution.\nSolution to Question 29:\nThe end product of the reaction of soda lime with CO2 is CaCO3+NaOH.\nCO2 absorbents contain hydroxide salts that are capable of neutralizing the carbonic acid.\nReaction end products include heat (the heat of neutralization), water, calcium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide.\nIts reactions are as follows:\nCO2 + H2O \uf0ae H2CO3\nH2CO3 + 2NaOH \uf0ae Na2CO3 + 2H2O + Heat (a fast reaction)\nNa2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 \uf0ae CaCO3 + 2NaOH + Heat (a slow reaction)\nNote that the water and sodium hydroxide initially required are regenerated.\nSolution to Question 30:\nThe water content of soda lime is 15%.\nDry CO2 absorbent (Baralyme &gt; Sodalime) can produce carbon monoxide.\nThe magnitude of CO production from greatest to least: Desflurane &gt;= Enflurane &gt;\nIsoflurane &gt;&gt; Halothane =Sevoflurane\nSolution to Question 31:\nLaminar flow mainly depends on the viscosity of gas while turbulent flow is more dependent on density.\nThe transition between laminar and turbulent flow is given by Reynold's number.\nRe = pvD/n\n(v- velocity of the fluid, p- density of the fluid, D- diameter of the tube, n- viscosity.) A Reynold's number &lt;2000 ~ laminar flow; &gt;4000 ~ turbulent flow.\nBLS and PALS\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following is the correct sequence?\nAssess the patient\u2019s response, Activate ERS, check carotid pulse, Start CPR\nCheck carotid pulse, Start CPR, Call for help and activate ERS, Defibrillate\nDefibrillate, Assess response, Check carotid pulse, Maintain airway\nStart CPR, Activate ERS, Defibrillate, Check pulse\nQuestion 2:\nOn your morning walk in the park, you notice an unconscious man lying on the ground.

Second step - Assess for responsiveness\nThird step \u2013 Proceed if the patient is unresponsive. Shout for help.\nIf the patient is unresponsive assess for breathing and carotid pulse simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe next best step is to Call for help, check pulse, do CPR, defibrillate If no pulse.\nSteps in basic life support:\nFirst step \u2013 Assess safety of the surroundings. Second step - Assess for responsiveness\nThird step \u2013 Proceed if the patient is unresponsive. Shout for help.\nIf the patient is unresponsive, assess for breathing and carotid pulse simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds.\nIn the given scenario, it is already mentioned that you are in a park (scene safety has been assessed), and that the person is unconscious (responsiveness has been assessed). So, the immediate next step is to call for help, and start CPR.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe first thing that needs to be done on witnessing a cardiac arrest is to verify the scene safety.\nOn ensuring that the scene is safe, the victim is checked for responsiveness. If unresponsive, call for help and then check for breathing and pulse simultaneously taking not more than 10 seconds.\nIf there is no breathing and no pulse, immediate chest compression and rescue breaths are started at a ratio of 30:2.\nIf there is a pulse, but no breathing, give one rescue breath every 5-6 seconds or about 10-12 breaths/min.\nWhen an automated external defibrillator arrives, the rhythm is checked; if shockable, one shock is administered and CPR is resumed immediately.\nIf not shockable, then CPR is resumed immediately.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe sequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation starts with circulation, airway and then breathing.\nMaintaining circulation involves chest compressions which lead to ejection of blood from the heart as a result of actual compression of the heart between the sternum and vertebral column.\nSolution to Question 5:\nLaryngeal mask airway and other supraglottic airway devices are part of advanced airway management, which is included in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).\nBasic life support refers to the emergency management of sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, stroke, and foreign body airway obstruction, usually without the use of equipment other than automated external defibrillators.\nThe CPR sequence is as follows - circulation (chest compression), airway, and then breathing:\nCirculation:\nChest compressions lead to ejection of blood from the heart, as a result of actual compression of the heart between the sternum and vertebral column.\nAirway:\nHead tilt, chin lift, and jaw thrust maneuvers are used to open the airway.\nBreathing:\nIf there is no adequate breathing even after opening the airway, the rescuer should initiate assisted ventilation by giving rescue breaths to the patient using mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-stoma, mouth-to-barrier device, mouth-to-face shield, or mouth-to-mask rescue breathing or by using a bag-mask device.\nDefibrillation:\nUsing automated external defibrillators (AED)\nSolution to Question 6:\nHigh-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation involves adequate chest compressions to a depth of at least 5 cm in adults.\nIf a feedback device is used, then the compression depth can be increased to 6 cm.\nSolution to Question 7:\nChest compressions should be performed at a rate of 100-120/ minute.\nSolution to Question 8:\nDuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation of adults, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\nIn infants and children, the ratio is 30:2 for a single-rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present.\nSolution to Question 9:\nIn children and adults, chest compressions are performed by locating the xiphoid process and placing the heel of the hand over the lower half of the sternum. The other hand is placed over the hand on the sternum with the fingers either interlaced or extended and the elbow extended so that the weight of the upper body is used for compression.\nIn infants, if there is a single rescuer, compressions are effected by placing 2 fingers in the center of the chest, just below the nipple line. If there are 2 or more rescuers, then 2 thumb technique is used.\nIn infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest, which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants.\nFor pediatric patients, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. In adults, the ratio is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe ideal rescue breath rate for adults is 10 breaths/min, while in infants and children up to puberty it is 20-30 breaths/min. As the person's age group is not specified in the question, assuming an adult, statement 1 is incorrect, while 2, 3, and 4 are correct.\nEffective chest compression in adults:\nProvide 100-120 compressions per minute (30 compressions for every 15-18 sec).\nPlace your arms, one over the other in the midline, on the lower 1/3rd of the patient's sternum, and lock your arms.\nUse both arms to press the chest to a depth of 5-6 cm (2 - 2.4 inches) or more.\nPress hard and fast\nAllow for full chest recoil after every compression.\nEffective chest compressions in a child older than 1 year and up to puberty:\nThe compression rate is 100 - 120/min (30 compressions for every 15-18 sec).\nOne or both palms are placed in the midline.\nThe depth of compression is 2 inches.\nPress hard and fast\nAllow for full chest recoil after every compression.

If there are 2 or more rescuers, then the ratio is 15:2.\nWhile giving rescue breaths, the airway is checked for a foreign body. If it is accessible, then the object can be removed. If not, then CPR is continued. Blind finger sweeping may be hazardous as it can push the object further down the airway.\nIf the child is responsive, then abdominal thrusts are performed to help relieve airway obstruction.\nIn a choking infant who is responsive, 5 back slaps between the shoulder blades and 5 downward thrusts on the chest are given in order to dislodge the foreign body.\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe device is an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).\nThis is a special medical device that is commonly used for recognizing the absence/presence of rapid ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. With no need for intervention by an operator, it determines whether an electrical shock right to the heart must be performed (defibrillation).\nAn automated external defibrillator can be used on those victims, who are unconscious and aren\u2019t breathing in a normal way. As a rule, it is used together with CPR in cases of sudden cardiac arrest. It is forbidden to use it on patients who are less than eight years old or those weighing less than 25 kgs.\nSolution to Question 14:\nAmerican Heart Association recommends the intraosseous (IO) route as an alternative to an intravenous route in order to deliver drugs and fluids, especially in children.\nThis is because intraosseous access can easily be made in 30-60 seconds and thus provide emergency vascular access. It involves placing a catheter into the marrow venous plexus and administering, crystalloids, colloids, drugs, and blood which leads to rapid and reliable absorption into the systemic circulation.\nSites of choice: proximal tibia, distal femur, the distal end of radius, or ulna.\nThe fluids are administered under pressure because of the resistance to fluid flow from the IO catheter into the IO space. The disadvantage with this route is the risk of osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, bone marrow or fat embolism.\nIO access is superior to the endotracheal route. The American Heart Association does not recommend an intramuscular route for cardiac resuscitation.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe site preferred for intraosseous access among the given options is proximal tibia. Other sites of choice are distal femur, distal end of radius, or ulna.\nIntraosseous access involves placing a catheter into the marrow venous plexus and administering, crystalloids, colloids, drugs, and blood which leads to rapid and reliable absorption into the systemic circulation.\nThe fluids are administered under pressure because of the resistance to fluid flow from the IO catheter into the IO space. The disadvantage with this route is the risk of osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, bone marrow or fat embolism.\nAmerican Heart Association recommends the intraosseous route as an alternative to an intravenous route in order to deliver drugs and fluids, especially in children. This is because intraosseous access can easily be made in 30-60 seconds and thus provide emergency vascular access.\nSolution to Question 16:\nAccording to the AHA 2020 guidelines, routine use of cricoid pressure is not recommended during the endotracheal intubation of pediatric patients.\nOption A: For pediatric patients in any setting, it is reasonable to administer the initial dose of epinephrine within 5 minutes from the start of chest compressions.\nOption B: It is reasonable to prefer cuffed ETTs over uncuffed ETTs for intubating infants and children to reduce air leak.\nOption D: For infants and children with a pulse but an absent or inadequate respiratory effort, 1 breath can be given every 2 to 3 seconds (20-30 breaths/min).\nSolution to Question 17:\nDuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present.\nIn adults, the ratio is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\nIn infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants.\nThe compression rate should be 100-120/minute.\nAllow complete chest recoil after each compression and minimize interruptions in compressions",

Excessive ventilation is to be avoided.\nSolution to Question 18:\nEpinephrine is the drug of choice for treating bradycardia in infants and children. The recommended dose is 0.01 mg/ kg of a 1:10,000 solution. It can be given intravenously or via the intraosseous route. It can be repeated every 3-5 minutes.\nIf intravenous or intraosseous access cannot be obtained, then it can be administered via the endotracheal route at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of a 1:1,000 solution.\nIf epinephrine is not effective in increasing the heart rate, then atropine can be used with a dose of 0.02 mg/kg and repeated.\nFor adults, treatment is initiated with 1 mg atropine iv which may be repeated at 3-5 minute intervals to a maximum dose of 3 mg. Along with atropine, transcutaneous pacing is to be done.\nSolution to Question 19:\nIn a pediatric cardiac arrest, the initial energy for defibrillation is set at 2 J/kg for\nboth monophasic and biphasic waveforms. It is increased to 4 J/kg if a second shock is required. If a pediatric defibrillator is not available, then an adult defibrillator can be used.\nIn children the most common cause of cardiac arrest is asphyxia. However, a sudden witnessed collapse in a child is usually due to ventricular fibrillation.\nFor adult defibrillation, the energy that must be applied is\nMonophasic defibrillator\u2013 360 J\nBiphasic defibrillator- 120-200 J (manufacturer recommended)\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe cut off value for increased QRS duration according to the AHA 2020 guidelines for pediatric management of tachycardia with a pulse is &gt;0.09 second. Wide QRS duration of &gt;0.09 second is suggestive of possible ventricular tachycardia.\nWhen a pediatric patient is in tachycardia, a 12-lead ECG is done to evaluate the rhythm and QRS complex duration. In addition, cardiopulmonary compromise is also assessed by checking for acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, and hypotension.\nBased on the QRS complex duration on the ECG, it can be:\nNarrow (\uf0a30.09 seconds) indicating a probable supraventricular tachycardia\nWide (&gt;0.09 seconds) indicating a possible ventricular tachycardia Treatment of patient with probable supraventricular tachycardia:\nPresence of cardiopulmonary compromise - adenosine\nAbsence of cardiopulmonary compromise - vagal maneuvers Treatment of patient with possible ventricular tachycardia:\nPresence of cardiopulmonary compromise - synchronized cardioversion\nAbsence of cardiopulmonary compromise - adenosine, if the the rhythm is regular and QRS is monomorphic\nACLS\nQuestion 1:\nA 45-year-old woman presented to the ER with dizziness.

If the patient is under spinal anesthesia, low-dose (0.2 mg) IV epinephrine can be given.\nEpinephrine is the drug of choice for treating bradyarrhythmias in infants and children.\nSolution to Question 2:\nAdenosine cannot be used in the treatment of this patient. It is used to treat supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, not bradyarrhythmias.\nThe scenario depicts a patient with symptomatic bradycardia, marked by acute altered mental status and hypotension with hypothyroidism as the risk factor.\nTreatment is indicated when bradycardia is accompanied by any one of the following:\nHypotension\nAcutely altered mental status\nSigns of shock\nIschemic chest discomfort\nAcute heart failure\nTreatment is initiated with 1 mg atropine iv which may be repeated at 3-5 minute intervals to a maximum dose of 3 mg.\nAlong with atropine, transcutaneous pacing is to be done.\nIf the bradycardia is refractory to both atropine and transcutaneous pacing, then IV infusions of dopamine (5 to 20 \uf06dg/kg/min) or epinephrine (2 to 10 \uf06dg/min) should be considered.\nIf the bradycardia is still not responding, then transvenous pacing should be tried. If the patient is under spinal anesthesia, low-dose (0.2 mg) IV epinephrine can be given.\nEpinephrine is the drug of choice for treating bradyarrhythmias in infants and children.\nSolution to Question 3:\nIV atropine is used in the treatment of symptomatic bradyarrhythmia starting at a dose of 1 mg, which can be repeated every 3-5 minutes to a maximum dose of 3 mg.\nAlong with atropine, transcutaneous pacing is to be done.\nIf the bradycardia is refractory to both atropine and transcutaneous pacing, then IV infusions of dopamine (5 to 20 \uf06dg/kg/min) or epinephrine (2 to 10 \uf06dg/min) should be considered.\nIf the bradycardia is still not responding, then transvenous pacing should be tried. If the patient is under spinal anesthesia, low-dose (0.2 mg) IV epinephrine can be given.\nEpinephrine is the drug of choice for treating bradyarrhythmias in infants and children.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe patient has paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. As the patient's blood pressure is normal and there is no evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, initial treatment consists of vagal maneuvers (Valsalva maneuver) in awake patients. This is because vagal maneuvers alone can terminate approximately 20% to 25% of reentry supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).\nIf this is unsuccessful, then IV adenosine 6 mg is given. If necessary another dose of adenosine 12 mg may be administered after 1-2 minutes.\nIf the drug is administered via a central venous catheter, then these doses are reduced to 3 mg and 6 mg, respectively.\nIf there is hemodynamic deterioration, then cardioversion is the treatment of choice.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe patient has paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.\nAs vagal maneuver has been found ineffective, then the next best step is to administer adenosine 6 mg IV.\nFor treating supraventricular tachycardia, the hemodynamic status of the patient has to be assessed. In this patient, as his blood pressure is normal and there is no evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, initial treatment consists of vagal maneuvers (Valsalva maneuver) in awake patients.\nIn this scenario, as this was unsuccessful, IV adenosine 6 mg had to be given. If necessary another dose of adenosine 12 mg may be administered after 1-2 minutes.\nIf the drug is administered via a central venous catheter, then these doses are reduced to 3 mg and 6 mg, respectively.\nIf there is hemodynamic deterioration, then cardioversion is the treatment of choice.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThis patient has supraventricular tachycardia with evidence of hemodynamic deterioration. Immediate treatment would be cardioversion (50-100J).\nIf the patient were hemodyamically stable, initial treatment would be vagal maneuvers (Valsalva maneuver) in awake patients. This is because vagal maneuvers alone can terminate approximately 20% to 25% of reentry supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).\nIf this is unsuccessful, then iv adenosine 6 mg is given. If necessary another dose of adenosine 12 mg may be administered after 1-2 minutes.\nIf the drug is administered via a central venous catheter, then these doses are reduced to 3 mg and 6 mg respectively.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe clinical scenario suggests supraventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic instability and the next step of management is DC cardioversion (50-100J).\nIf the patient was hemodyamically stable, initial treatment would be vagal maneuvers (Valsalva maneuver) in awake patients. This is because vagal maneuvers alone can terminate approximately 20% to 25% of reentry supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).\nIf this is unsuccessful, then iv adenosine 6 mg is given. If necessary another dose of adenosine 12 mg may be administered after 1-2 minutes.\nIf the drug is administered via a central venous catheter, then these doses are reduced to 3 mg and 6 mg respectively.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment of choice is IV Ibutilide.\nIbutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinus rhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period.\nIt is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can be administered 10 minutes after the first.\nIf there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment of choice.\nCardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronized with the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration of shock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized.\nHowever, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travel from the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium at once to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made to interrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node can take back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity.\nCardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent such as midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse is imminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should be preferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedative agents.\nEnergy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic or biphasic.\nMonophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasic defibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electrically opposite direction for the second half.\nBiphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistent magnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies than monophasic waveform defibrillators.\nEnergy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energy requirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010.\nAtrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows:",

The next line of management is to administer procainamide, class IA antiarrhythmic drug.\nAntiarrhythmic therapy for stable wide QRS tachycardia include procainamide, amiodarone, or sotalol. Synchronized cardioversion is considered when the patient is unstable.\nWhen a patient is in tachyarrhythmia typically with a heart rate of \uf0b3150 per minute, the initial intervention consists of identifying and treating the underlying cause. This includes:\nMaintaining a patent airway and assisting breathing as necessary\nAdministering oxygen if hypoxemic\nAttaching cardiac monitor to identify rhythm; monitor blood pressure and oximetry\nWhen there is persistent tachyarrhythmia, the management is as depicted by the flowchart (based on the AHA guidelines) below:\n\nOption B: Adenosine is used in regular narrow complex tachycardia.\nOption C: Lidocaine has limiting side effects and, increase the overall mortality risk.\nOption D: It is the treatment for immediately life-threatening arrhythmias with which the patient does not have a pulse, ie ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).\nSolution to Question 10:\nChronic use of loop diuretics such as furosemide can predispose to hypomagnesemia. The given ECG classically depicts polymorphic ventricular tachycardia\u2014torsades de pointes. Torsade rhythm is most commonly is seen in association with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia.\nTorsades de pointes is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia meaning \u201ctwisting of the points,\u201d characterized by twisting of the QRS axis around the baseline and a polymorphic appearance.\nThere is QT interval prolongation in the ECG due to a non-uniform delay in repolarization. The other cause of torsades de pointes include:\nDrugs like quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and phenothiazine (amiodarone is rarely associated with torsades de pointes because the delay in repolarization induced by it is uniform).\nBradycardia\nAcute ischemia or infarction Management:\nDiscontinue the offending drug\nCorrect electrolyte abnormalities, pH and hypoxia\nMagnesium sulphate infusion\nIncrease the heart rate - electrical pacing, isoproterenol infusion, or intravenous atropine\nSolution to Question 11:\nHypovolemia and hypoxia are the two most common causes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA).\nMost likely causes of Pulseless electrical activity:\nIn a trauma patient: hypovolemia, cardiac tamponade, and tension pneumothorax\nIn the intraoperative or postoperative period: acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism or air embolism\nIn pregnant women: uterine compression of the inferior vena cava, amniotic fluid embolism, or uterine rupture.\nSolution to Question 12:\nA pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is a non-shockable rhythm. Defibrillation is of no benefit. PEA involves a heterogeneous group of cardiac rhythms all without a pulse.\nThe immediate treatment for this is giving chest compressions and 1 mg epinephrine at the earliest until more definitive therapy to the cause can be instituted.\nIt is essential to rule out the reversible causes of cardiac arrest because the treatment for each of them is different and PEA is likely to persist until the cause is treated.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe most common cardiac rhythm seen in adults experiencing sudden cardiac arrest is asystole, as recorded at initial contact in 45\u201350% of cases.\nPreviously VF was thought to be the common rhythm, but its incidence has now been decreasing.\nSolution to Question 14:\nIn children, the more common cause of cardiac arrest is asphyxia rather than ventricular fibrillation.\nEven though asphyxia is the more common cause, pediatric resuscitation starts with chest compressions rather than rescue breaths as in adults for simplicity in training. This is because the cycle of 30 chest compressions before rescue breathing delays ventilation for only 15 to 20 seconds.\nDuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. In adults, the ratio is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\nIn infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants.\nSolution to Question 15:\nAsystole is a non-shockable rhythm. Treatment for both involves starting CPR immediately and administering 1 mg epinephrine IV.\nAsystole is the complete and sustained absence of electrical activity. It is usually seen as a terminal rhythm in a resuscitation attempt that started with another rhythm, or in a patient with unwitnessed or prolonged cardiac arrest. The prognosis for persistent asystole is poor.\nAnother example of a non-shockable rhythm is Pulseless electrical activity. It involves a heterogeneous group of cardiac rhythms, all without a pulse.\nIt is essential to rule out the reversible causes of cardiac arrest because the treatment for each of them is different and PEA is likely to persist until the cause is treated.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe patient has an organized, apparently normal ECG without a pulse - i.e the patient has pulseless electrical activity (PEA). A pulseless electrical activity involves a heterogeneous group of cardiac rhythms, all without a pulse.\nThe immediate treatment for this is giving chest compressions and 1 mg epinephrine at the earliest until definitive therapy to the cause can be instituted.\nIt is essential to rule out the reversible causes of cardiac arrest because the treatment for each of them is different and PEA is likely to persist until the cause is treated.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe ECG rhythm shown is ventricular fibrillation which is treated by immediate defibrillation.\nThe management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (shockable rhythms) is the same. Immediate chest compression is to be started.\nIt is of utmost necessity to defibrillate at the earliest because the chances of survival decrease by 7-10% every minute without defibrillation.\nDefibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so as to interrupt the disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole for at least 5 seconds.\nThe energy that must be applied is\nMonophasic defibrillator\u2013 360 J\nBiphasic defibrillator- 120 J\nSolution to Question 18:\nChest compressions should be resumed immediately following shock delivery.\nPulse check and reanalysis of the cardiac rhythm is performed only after 2 minutes of chest compression and rescue breaths. This is because the heart is temporarily stunned by a defibrillator shock and so chest compressions would benefit the patient by providing coronary blood flow during this period.\nDefibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so as to interrupt disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole for at least 5 seconds. It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate immediately because the chances of survival decrease by 7-10% every minute without defibrillation.\nIf after 2 minutes, the rhythm remains the same, then another shock is delivered. Chest compression and rescue breaths are resumed and 1 mg epinephrine is administered.\nConsideration is given for an advanced airway placement.\nIf after 2 minutes the rhythm still remains the same, the first dose of amiodarone 300mg bolus is given.\nWith the next cycle of CPR, a shock is delivered and 1 mg of epinephrine is given. And with the cycle of CPR after that, shock is delivered and the second dose of amiodarone- 150mg is given\nSolution to Question 19:\nVasopressin was a part of the resuscitation protocol in the 2010 American Heart Association\n(AHA) cardiac arrest algorithm but it has been removed from the 2015 guidelines.\nVasopressin causes intense peripheral vasoconstriction due to stimulation of V1 receptors in the endothelium but it causes a limited increase in myocardial contractility, myocardial and cerebral oxygen consumption, and metabolic demands. Thus it doesn\u2019t have much of a survival benefit.\nEpinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest.\nThe first dose of epinephrine,1 mg IV, is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered and it is continued every 3-5 minutes.\nIf this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150 mg given if necessary\nSolution to Question 20:\nIntravenous Adrenaline is the drug of choice for CPR. However, adrenaline can be given intratracheally also. The concentration required for intratracheal administration is 2-2.5 times more than required for the IV route.\nOption B: Intracardiac injection is not recommended as it can cause myocardial damage. Recommended routes for adrenaline are intravenous, intraosseous (children), and intra-tracheal.\nOption C: Adrenaline converts fine fibrillation to coarse fibrillation which then responds well to defibrillation.\nOption D: Adrenaline is available as a 1 mL injection containing 1 mg of adrenaline in 1:1000 concentration. The dose used in cardiac arrest is 1mg of adrenaline every 3-5 minutes, usually given as 1ml in 1:1000 concentration or 10ml in 1:10,000 concentration (more preferred since in cardiac arrest peripheral circulation is absent; hence larger volume is required for the drug to reach the central circulation).\nSolution to Question 21:\nEpinephrine is used in cardiac arrest patients at a dose of 10 mL of 1: 10,000 solution (1 mg epinephrine).\nEpinephrine is an adrenergic agonist: \uf0b0 -Adrenergic effects increase myocardial blood flow.\n\uf062-Adrenergic effects increases myocardial contractility.\nIndication: VF/VT, electromechanical dissociation, ventricular asystole, severe bradycardia unresponsive to atropine or pacing, severe hypotension.\nDose: 1 mg IV. Repeat doses every 3\u20135 min as necessary. Administration down a tracheal tube requires higher doses (2\u20132.5 mg in adults).\nSolution to Question 22:\nSodium bicarbonate cannot be administered via the endotracheal route.\nThe dosage for intratracheal route is 2-2.5 times higher than the intravenous dose. The drugs should be diluted in 10 ml of normal saline or distilled water for adults and 5 ml for children.\nWhen there is no intravenous access, the intraosseous route is preferred over the endotracheal route because the optimal dose via the endotracheal route is not known. Also, CPR needs to be stopped momentarily as the drug may be regurgitated up the endotracheal tube during chest compression.\nSolution to Question 23:\nEpinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for the resuscitation of a cardiac arrest patient.\nThe first dose of epinephrine 1 mg IV is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered and it is continued every 3-5 minutes.\nIf this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150 mg given if necessary\nSolution to Question 24:\nAccording to the post-cardiac arrest care algorithm, targeted temperature management is the maintenance of a constant target temperature between 32-360C for at least 24 hours.\nThis is done in post-cardiac resuscitation patients who have achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), but are still comatose.\nThe entire body is to be cooled using a combination of methods like fluid-filled cooling blankets, ice packs, forced air blankets, cold IV fluids, and/or invasive devices or catheters.\nIt has been found to be the only intervention that can improve neurological recovery after cardiac arrest. It is most beneficial in ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia patients.\nSolution to Question 25:\nPerimortem cesarean delivery should be considered if there is no return of spontaneous circulation in 5 minutes, according to the AHA 2020 Guidelines.\nWhen a pregnant woman is in cardiac arrest, high-quality CPR and defibrillation are performed and epinephrine is administered. The maternal cardiac arrest team is assembled to look for the etiology and perform the following interventions:\nMaternal interventions:\nAirway management\nAdministration of of 100% O2\nPlacing the IV above the diaphragm\nIf the patient is on IV magnesium - stopping it and administering calcium chloride or gluconate\nObstetric interventions:\nContinuous lateral uterine displacement\nAfter performing the above-mentioned interventions, if there is no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in 5 minutes, a perimortem cesarean section is considered.\nVentilation and O2 Delivery Systems\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following is not a low-flow variable performance device?\nNasal cannula\nNon-rebreathing mask\nNasal mask\nAnaesthetic bag\nQuestion 2:\nWhat is the maximum percentage of oxygen that can be delivered via nasal cannula?",

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nAnaesthetic bag or the bag-mask-valve system is a high flow fixed performance system - the delivered FiO2 is not affected by changes in ventilatory level or breathing pattern of the patient and thus deliver accurate oxygen concentration. It is of two types: the self-inflating bags with a reservoir of 1.5 L and the non-self-inflating bags with a reservoir of 1, 2 or 3 L.\nThe disadvantage is high cost and poor patient tolerability due to high flow. The other fixed performance devices include venturi mask, air-entraining nebulizers, and high flow air oxygen systems.\nThe nasal cannula, non\u2013rebreathing mask, and nasal mask are low flow variable performance systems. Oxygen is delivered at a low, fixed flow which is only a portion of the inspired gas mixture. They are cheap with better patient tolerability. The disadvantage is that the FiO2 delivered cannot be accurately predicted, so they are suitable for patients with stable breathing patterns.\nHigh flow systems\nLow flow systems\nFixed performance systems\nVariable performance system s\nExamples:venturi maskair-en training nebulizershigh flow air oxygen systemsanaestheti c bag\nExamples:nasal cannulanon\u2013 rebreathing masknasal mask\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe nasal cannula is a low flow variable performance oxygen delivery system that can achieve a maximum inspired oxygen concentration of 40-50 % if flow rates are greater than 10L/ min for short periods.\nFlow rates greater than 5 L/min are not tolerated because of the discomfort associated with this high flow entering the nasal cavity and also due to drying and crusting of the nasal mucosa.\nAt flow rates of 3-4 L, it can provide an inspired oxygen concentration of 30-35%. In mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the percentage of oxygen delivered is 16%.\nSolution to Question 3:\nA nasal cannula is a low flow variable performance oxygen delivery system. It is not suited for patients requiring high FiO2 or inspiratory oxygen flow rates greater than 40 L/min for which devices like venturi mask, anaesthetic bag, air-entraining nebulizers, or high flow air oxygen systems are preferred.\nIndications of a nasal cannula and other low-flow oxygen delivery systems include\nMinute ventilation &lt; 8\u201310 L/min\nBreathing frequencies &lt; 20 breaths/min\nTidal volumes (V T ) &lt; 0.8 L\nNormal inspiratory flow (10\u201330 L/min).\nSolution to Question 4:\nVenturi mask is a high-flow, fixed-performance oxygen delivery system and the highest oxygen concentration (FiO2) delivered is 60% at a flow rate of 15 L/min.\nIt is available in different colors, with the green valve venturi mask providing 60% FiO2.\nThis is useful with patients who require greater FiO2 such as COPD patients, where it is important to provide controlled oxygenation.\n\nColour of Venturi valv e\nFiO2\n(%)\nFlow rate(L/mi n)\nBlue",

A fist is made with one hand and using the other hand, the fist is driven into the patient\u2019s abdomen with a rapid, forceful upward thrust so as to dislodge the foreign body. This is continued until the foreign body is expelled or if the patient becomes unresponsive.\nIf the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR.\n\nIn a choking infant who is responsive, 5 back slaps between the shoulder blades and 5 downward thrusts on the chest are given in order to dislodge the foreign body.\nIf the patient becomes unresponsive, immediately start CPR.\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nTracheostomy is performed in an intubated patient after 2-3 weeks.\nThis is because if an orotracheal or nasotracheal tube is left in situ for more than 2-3 weeks, it results in subglottic stenosis.\nHence it is ideal to replace the endotracheal tube with a cuffed tracheostomy tube.\nIf on intubation, it is perceived that the patient may require intubation for a period longer than 2 weeks, then tracheostomy can be performed soon after intubation.\nTracheostomy has been found to reduce the incidence of pneumonia, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in hospitals for patients with major head injuries.\nSolution to Question 7:\nArterial CO2 tension &lt; 50 mm Hg is not an indication for mechanical ventilation.

    "question_text": "\na\nSolution to Question 1:\nSuccinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant.\nOption A: It produces both phase I and phase II block (at a higher dose).\nOption B: Succinylcholine can produce a rise in intracranial pressure as a result of increased cerebral blood flow due to muscle fasciculations.\nOption C: Precurarization is the administration of a small dose of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, a few minutes before Sch to minimize complications like fasciculations, post-operative myalgia, rise in intragastric pressure, and rise in ICP.\nSolution to Question 2:\nSuxamethonium (succinylcholine) is the shortest-acting muscle relaxant.\nIt has a rapid-onset (30\u201360secs) and short duration of action (typically less than 10 min) due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase).\nSolution to Question 3:\nSuccinylcholine is the muscle relaxant of choice for rapid sequence intubation. Although succinylcholine causes increase in ICP, it is used in rapid sequence intubation.\nSuccinylcholine has a rapid onset of action and is the shortest acting muscle relaxant. It provides muscle relaxation within 30-60 seconds.\nIf succinylcholine is contraindicated, then the non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, rocuronium can be used.\nSolution to Question 4:\nSuxamethonium (also known as succinylcholine) produces both phases I and II blocks. Suxamethonium is a depolarizing muscle relaxant.\nMechanism of depolarizing blockade:\nPhase I block - continuous endplate depolarization and subsequent muscle relaxation.\nPhase II block - seen with a single, large dose, repeated doses, or a continuous infusion which can lead to desensitization of the receptors resulting in the prolonged neuromuscular blockade.\nPhase II block has features of a non-depolarizing blockade. But 'phase II' is specifically used for depolarizing blockade by succinylcholine.\nSolution to Question 5:\nFade is seen in the non-depolarising phase II block caused by depolarizing muscle relaxants.\nDepolarising neuromuscular blockers result in prolonged depolarization with a brief period of fasciculations (repetitive excitation) followed by blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis. This is termed as phase I block and cannot be reversed by neostigmine as the membrane is in a depolarised state.\nThe depolarised nerves are unresponsive to other stimuli during this period.\nAs the concentration of the drug and time increases, the block may convert slowly to a\nnon-depolarising phase II block. Fade can be seen in this phase. The phase II block is reversible by neostigmine but is difficult to predict and usually avoided in clinical conditions.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe most likely reason which led to this scenario is phase II blockade produced by succinylcholine.\nPhase II block is clinically seen with the dose &gt;5 mg/kg. It is seen with a single large dose, repeated doses, or a continuous infusion of Sch which can lead to desensitization of the receptors resulting in a prolonged neuromuscular blockade.\nCauses of prolonged apnea include:\nAtypical/pseudocholinesterase deficiency - can result in apnea even with a normal dose of succinylcholine\nAltered response of endplate to depolarizing relaxant (myasthenia gravis)\nAccumulation of succinylcholine leading to phase II blockade\nNote: Although options A, B, and D can lead to prolonged apnea, in the above case scenario, the patient has received ~9 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Hence, the most probable diagnosis is phase II blockade leading to prolonged apnea.\nSolution to Question 7:\nPhase I depolarizing block is preceded by muscle fasciculation.\nNote: Cholinesterase inhibitors are not routinely used to reverse phase II blockade as certain individuals have abnormal cholinesterase activity (due to genotypic variations). Their response to cholinesterase activity is unpredictable. Thus a wait and watch policy is implemented where the patient is put on a ventilator (100% O2) and observed for 24-48 hours until spontaneous reversal.\nPhase I\nPhase II\nDepolarizing block\nNon-depolarizing block\nNo fade during repetitive sti mulation\nFadeduring repetitive stimula tion (tetanic or Train Of Four)\nNo post-tetanic facilitation\nPost tetanic facilitation(poten tiation)\nPhase I\tPhase II\nPhase I\tPhase II\nB ock antagonized by rapidhy drolysisdue tobutyrylcholines terase/plasma cholinesterase\nB ock can be antagonized by administering acholinesteras e inhibitorlike neostigmine.\nSolution to Question 8:\nSuccinylcholine exhibits the above-given response to the 'train of four protocol' used in the clinical assessment of neuromuscular blockade.\nTrain of four protocol is one of the methods used in the clinical assessment of neuromuscular blockade. It is done by stimulating the ulnar nerve with a stimulus and watching the contractile responses in the adductor pollicis muscle. Four successive stimuli of 2Hz strength are given at fixed time intervals and the response achieved is plotted as a graph.\n\nNon-depolarizing blockers\nDepolarizing blockers\nFade phenom enon\nPresent\nPhase 1: AbsentPhase 2: Pres ent\nMechanism\nInitial stimulus: Amount of A ch released is large enough to compete with the drug at the motor endplate causing max imal contraction of the muscl e.Successive stimuli: Amount of Ach released is insufficien t to compete with the drug an d results in sequentially dimi nished contractions\nPhase 1: No competition betw een Sch and Ach. Sch acts lik e Ach at its receptors, but is not as easily metabolized by acetylcholinesterases resultin g in persistent depolarisation. Phase 2: When the dose of Sc h is increased maximally, it a lso exhibits a fade phenomen on.\nSolution to Question 9:\nSuccinylcholine stimulates the autonomic ganglia.\nParasympathetic ganglion (vagal ganglion) - bradycardia\nSympathetic ganglion - hypertension and tachycardia.\nPancuronium causes tachycardia by blocking the cardiac muscarinic receptor and not by stimulation of autonomic ganglia.\nD-tubocurarine blocks the autonomic ganglia. Whereas vercuronium does not act on autonomic ganglia.\nSolution to Question 10:\nReversal of neuromuscular blockade is usually not needed in cases where succinylcholine is used, as it is rapidly metabolized by pseudocholinesterase resulting in a short duration of action.\nCholinesterase inhibitors can prolong neuromuscular blockade produced by succinylcholine by increasing neuromuscular junction ACh concentration and inhibiting the pseudocholinesterase-induced metabolism of succinylcholine.\nSolution to Question 11:\nSuccinyl choline produces hyperkalemia not hypokalemia.\nUse of succinylcholine increases the plasma K+ levels by 0.5 mEq/L. This increase in K+ is well tolerated by healthy individuals but could be deliterious in patients with severe metabolic acidosis and hypovolemia.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe muscle relaxant administered was likely suxamethonium (succinylcholine). It is associated with muscle fasciculations and myalgia.\nAdministration of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant like rocuronium prior to succinylcholine\n(precurarization) is effective in preventing fasciculations and reducing postoperative myalgias.\nSolution to Question 13:\nRocuronium is the agent of choice for precurarization.\nPrecurarization is the administration of a small dose (10% of ED95) of a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, a few minutes before succinylcholine to\nminimize complications like fasciculations, postoperative myalgia, and rise in intragastric,\nintraocular, and intracranial pressure.\nRocuronium is ideal because it has a rapid onset of action (90 seconds), which is comparable with succinylcholine and is very effective in decreasing fasciculations and postoperative myalgias.\nSolution to Question 14:\nAll the given conditions except myasthenia gravis are associated with the risk of hyperkalemia from succinylcholine (SCh)\nIn patients with myasthenia gravis:\nDepolarizing muscle relaxants (SCh) - resistant\nNon-depolarizing muscle relaxants - hypersensitive\nAll the other options include conditions that can have preexisting hyperkalemia. Thus, the succinylcholine-induced release of potassium from skeletal muscles may lead to catastrophic hyperkalemia in these patients.\nSolution to Question 15:\nSuccinylcholine increases intragastric pressure. This is likely due to fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscle.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe renal disease does not affect the activity of butyrylcholinesterase.\nButyrylcholinesterase is the enzyme that degrades succinylcholine. It is synthesized in the liver and found in the plasma.\nReduced butyrylcholinesterase activity is seen in:\nLiver disease\nPregnancy\nMalnutrition\nOld age\nDrugs like - oral contraceptives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, echothiophate, cytotoxic drugs, anticholinesterase drugs, and metoclopramide.\nDecreased butyrylcholinesterase is not a major concern in clinical practice because even a large decrease in the enzyme activity will produce only a slight increase in the duration of neuromuscular blockade.\nSolution to Question 17:\nCalcium causes resistance to neuromuscular blockade caused by succinylcholine.\nNeostigmine being an anticholinesterase leads to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This results in a higher ACh concentration at the nerve terminal, which intensifies depolarization.\nNeostigmine, oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), metoclopramide, and aminoglycosides\n(streptomycin) can potentiate the paralysis produced by succinylcholine.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe mainstay in the treatment of succinylcholine apnea due to atypical pseudocholinesterase is to continue mechanical ventilation until muscle function returns to normal by clinical signs.\nOption B: Administration of neostigmine is controversial as the effects may be transient, possibly followed by an intensified neuromuscular blockade.\nOption C: Fresh frozen plasma can augment the patient's endogenous plasma pseudocholinesterase activity but is not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic viral infections.\nNote: If human plasma cholinesterase is available, it can be given to reverse neuromuscular blockade.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe first line of management in this child would be to increase the dose of succinylcholine.\nThe incidence of muscle spasms without any symptoms and signs of malignant hyperthermia frequently results from an inadequate dosage of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine dosage for intubation is 1-2mg/kg\nConditions to be ruled out in isolated masseteric spasm:\nInadequate dose of succinylcholine (less than the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg)\nInadequate time for the onset of succinylcholine action\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonia congenita, and other muscle disorders\nTemporomandibular joint dislocation\nConfusion-buster: Although an increase in the tone of the masseter is considered to be an early indicator of malignant hyperthermia, this finding is not consistently associated with it.\nSolution to Question 20:\nDibucaine number indicates the genetic makeup of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. It is a qualitative measure that measures pseudocholinesterase function but\nnot the amount of enzyme.\nA patient with normal pseudocholinesterase has a dibucaine number of 80; whereas a homozygote for an atypical enzyme will have a dibucaine number of 20.\nTherefore, the adequacy of pseudocholinesterase can be determined quantitatively in units per liter - in the laboratory\nSolution to Question 21:\nSuccinylcholine and mivacurium are eliminated through hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases. Thus, in a patient with a low Dibucaine number, both of these drugs should be avoided. Both drugs can cause prolonged apnea in patients with atypical plasma cholinesterase.\nDibucaine number refers to the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesterase activity.\nSolution to Question 22:\nBaclofen is a centrally acting selective GABA-B receptor agonist used as a muscle relaxant. It hyperpolarizes neurons by increasing potassium conductance and altering calcium influx.\nCentrally acting muscle relaxants reduce skeletal muscle tone by a selective action in the cerebrospinal axis without altering consciousness.\nC assification of centrally acting muscle relaxants:\nMephenesin congeners - mephenesin, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, chlormezanone, methocarbamol.\nBenzodiazepines - diazepam and others.\nGABA mimetic - baclofen, thiocolchicoside.\nCentral \uf0b0 2 receptor agonist - tizanidine.\nSolution to Question 23:\nCalcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased by dantrolene.\nIt is a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant that acts on the RyR1 (ryanodine receptor) calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscles and inhibits calcium-induced calcium release. It results in the uncoupling of membrane depolarization and muscle contraction.\nIV dantrolene is the drug of choice for malignant hyperthermia which is due to the persistent release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\nSolution to Question 24:\nSuxamethonium or succinyl choline is a depolarizing muscle relaxant.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe curare group of drugs includes non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents that act by competitively blocking the binding of acetylcholine to its receptors.\nThis leads to a decrease in the effect of acetylcholine and thus, neuronal transmission to the muscle does not occur.\nSolution to Question 2:\nMivacurium is the shortest acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant among the given options. Thus, the fastest recovery will occur on the administration of mivacurium.\nGantacurium is the shortest acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant.\nSolution to Question 3:\nRocuronium has the fastest onset of action among non-depolarising blockers.\nSuccinylcholine's onset is comparable with rocuronium, but succinylcholine is a depolarising blocker.\nThe onset of action:\nRocuronium- 0.5-2 minutes\nSuccinylcholine- 0.8-1.4 minutes\nMivacurium- 2-3 minutes\nVecuronium- 2-3 minutes\nSolution to Question 4:\nGantacurium is an ultra-short acting, rapid-onset, non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that undergoes non-enzymatic degradation.\nIt belongs to the mixed-onium fumarate group.\nL-cysteine adduction results in the formation of a heterocyclic ring that cannot interact with the Ach receptor in the post-junctional space. The administration of L-cysteine can thus rapidly inactivate fumarate compounds and reverse neuromuscular blockade.\nIt is available as a lyophilized powder which must be reconstituted before use. It is unstable as an aqueous solution.\nNote: Atracurium, cis-atracurium and gantacurium undergo non-enzymatic degradation.\nSolution to Question 5:\nMivacurium is preferred as it undergoes rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase/ pseudocholinesterase).\nMivacurium is a short-acting muscle relaxant preferred in day-care anesthesia. It has an onset of action within 2-3 minutes and a duration of action of 10-20 minutes.\nPatients with atypical pseudocholinesterase will have a prolonged duration of the block similar to succinylcholine administration.\nSolution to Question 6:\nElimination of mivacurium is independent of kidney function.\nMivacurium is a short-acting, non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. It is the only non-depolarizing agent that is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase).\nIt is safe to use in a patient with or at risk of intracranial hypertension.\nIt can cause histamine release but in lesser quantities as compared to tubocurarine.\nSolution to Question 7:\nCis\u2013atracurium is an intermediate-acting muscle relaxant, and would be unsuitable for long procedures.\nSolution to Question 8:\nAtracurium can cause seizures due to the accumulation of its metabolite, laudanosine.\nLaudanosine, a tertiary amine, is a breakdown product of atracurium's Hofmann elimination. It has CNS-stimulating properties and can result in precipitation of seizures but this is significant only with large doses and hepatic failure.\nCisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium, which results in lesser laudanosine production than atracurium.\nSolution to Question 9:\nAtracurium is avoided in asthmatic patients because it is associated with histamine release and bronchospasm.\nIt is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and non-specific ester hydrolysis. Hofmann elimination is a spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation of atracurium into laudanosine and\nmono-quaternary acrylate. Laudanosine has CNS stimulating properties and can result in precipitation of seizures.\nAtracurium precipitates as a free acid if it is introduced into an intravenous line containing an alkaline solution such as thiopental. Thus, the 2 drugs are chemically incompatible.\nSolution to Question 10:\nAtracurium is a benzylisoquinoline derivative.\nClassification of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants according to structure:\nSteroidal compounds:\nPancuronium\nPipecuronium\nVecuronium\nRocuronium\nBenzylisoquinoline compounds:\nd - Tubocurarine\nMetacurine\nDoxacurium\nAtracurium\nCisatracurium\nMivacurium\nOnium chlorofumarate compounds - Gantacurium\nPhenolic ethers - Gallamine\nDiallyl derivative of toxiferine - Alcuronium\nSolution to Question 11:\nCisatracurium does not cause histamine release, atracurium does.\nOption A: Cisatracurium produces laudanosine, but it is about five times lesser than that of atracurium.\nOption B: Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent.\nOption C: Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination which is a spontaneous non-enzymatic organ-independent degradation (independent of renal function). Hence it is the drug of choice in renal failure patients.\nSolution to Question 12:\nRocuronium is the drug of choice during routine intubation in pediatric patients due to its faster onset of action and its availability as an intramuscular injection.\nSuccinylcholine is avoided for routine, elective intubation in children due to its side effects. The only indication for intravenous succinylcholine in children is rapid sequence induction with a \u201cfull\u201d stomach and laryngospasm.\nThe durations of action of vecuronium and pancuronium are prolonged in children due to immature hepatic function.\nSolution to Question 13:\nAtracurium (or cisatracurium) is the ideal muscle relaxant for neonates.\nNeonates have immature hepatic and renal functions. Atracurium and cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination, which is spontaneous non-organ dependent non-enzymatic degradation. These drugs are independent of hepatic or renal excretion.\nSolution to Question 14:\nPancuronium is vagolytic (resulting from blockade of M2 receptors) leading to increased heart rate and hence increased blood pressure and cardiac output.\nThe vagolytic action of pancuronium may be used to counteract opioid-induced bradycardia. Note: Gallamine has the most potent vagolytic properties of any relaxant but is not in use.\nEffect\nStimulation\nBlockade\nAutonomic ganglia\nSuccinylcholine\nd-Tubocurarine\nCardiacmuscarinic recept or\nSuccinylcholine\nRocuronium (weak)Pancuron ium (moderate)\nHistamine release\nSuccinylcholine, mivacurium, atracurium (weak)d-tubocur arine (significant)\nSolution to Question 15:\nVecuronium is devoid of significant cardiovascular effects and is the most cardiostable muscle relaxant, making it the muscle relaxant of choice in cardiac patients.\nEffect\nStimulation\nBlockade\nAutonomic ganglia\nSuccinylcholine\nd-Tubocurarine\nCardiacmuscarinic recept or\nSuccinylcholine\nRocuronium (weak)Pancuron ium (moderate)\nHistamine release\nSuccinylcholine, mivacurium, atracurium (weak)d-tubocur arine (significant)\nSolution to Question 16:\nPancuronium is avoided as it is predominantly eliminated by the kidney and hence, can accumulate in renal failure or imapirment.\nAtracurium and cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination, i.e., spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation which is non-organ dependant.\nMetabolism of mivacurium is independent of the kidney function as it is hydrolyzed by butyrylcholinesterase.\nSolution to Question 17:\nRapacuronium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that has a very high incidence of bronchospasm (&gt;9%) and so it is contraindicated in asthmatics.\nIt has been withdrawn from the market due to this effect.\nRapacuronium has a rapid onset and short duration of action and minimal cardiovascular side effects.\nSolution to Question 18:\nd-Tubocurarine produces maximum ganglionic blockade leading to hypotension.\nd-Tubocurarine is the most potent histamine releaser among muscle relaxants leading to bronchospasm, hypotension, and wheals. The effects of the ganglionic blockade and histamine release can lead to severe hypotension. Hence, d-tubocurarine had been withdrawn from the market.\nSuccinylcholine stimulates the vagal ganglion, leading to bradycardia, and stimulates the sympathetic ganglion, causing hypertension and tachycardia.\nPancuronium is vagolytic and produces sympathetic stimulation leading to tachycardia.\nEffect\nStimulation\nBlockade\nAutonomic ganglia\nSuccinylcholine\nd-Tubocurarine\nCardiacmuscarinic recept or\nSuccinylcholine\nRocuronium (weak)Pancuron ium (moderate)\nHistamine release\nSuccinylcholine, mivacurium, atracurium (weak)d-tubocur arine (significant)\nSolution to Question 19:\nCis-atracurium is preferred in patients with renal impairment as it does not depend on the kidney for excretion.\nBoth atracurium and cis-atracurium undergo Hofmann elimination and are thus safe in renal disease.\nSteroidal muscle relaxants are predominantly eliminated by ultrafiltration by the glomeruli before urinary excretion. Doxacurium, pancuronium, and pipecuronium are partially excreted by the kidneys, so the neuromuscular block is prolonged in patients with renal failure.\nSolution to Question 20:\nAtracurium and cisatracurium are the muscle relaxants of choice in liver disease because of non-hepatic metabolism.\nAtracurium and cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination. The clearance of both drugs is independent of liver function. Hence, they are the agents of choice in liver failure patients.\nPancuronium, rocuronium, and vecuronium are dependent on the liver for excretion.\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of histamine release. Atracurium is the most potent histamine releaser among the given options and was likely administered.\nErythema, flushing, and hypotension are manifestations of histamine release.\nSolution to Question 22:\nAnticholinergic drugs like glycopyrrolate and atropine are not used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. They only attenuate the undesirable muscarinic effects of anticholinesterase reversal agents.\nReversal agents commonly used in clinical practice:\nCholinesterase inhibitors - Neostigmine (most common), edrophonium, and pyridostigmine.\nSugammadex, a cyclodextrin, is the first selective relaxant binding agent for rocuronium and vecuronium.\nL-cysteine causes the inactivation of gantacurium.\nSolution to Question 23:\nAdductor pollicis is the last to recover from neuromuscular blockade among the given choices. Most sensitive to neuromuscular blockade:\nDiaphragm and abdominal muscles\nPeripheral muscles of the limbs\nOrbicularis oculi muscle\nGeniohyoid\nMasseter\nUpper airway muscles.\nNote: Sensitivity and recovery are not exactly the same. Even though the laryngeal adductors recover sooner than adductor pollicis, recovery of adductor pollicis function does not exactly parallel the complete recovery of muscles required to maintain an airway. This may lead to dynamic obstruction postoperatively.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe best sign of recovery from neuromuscular blockade is a train of four ratio &gt;0.9\nThe TOF ratio must exceed 0.90 to exclude clinically important residual neuromuscular block. Clinical signs consistent with recovery are:\nSustained head lift for 5 seconds\nSustained leg lift for 5 seconds\nSustained handgrip for 5 seconds\nSustained \u201ctongue depressor test\u201d\nMaximum inspiratory pressure 40 to 50 cm H2O or greater\nSolution to Question 25:\nNeostigmine has no effect on potassium efflux.\nNeostigmine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. Its primary mechanism of action is decreased breakdown of acetylcholine at the motor endplate.\nMinor actions:\nIncreases the release of acetylcholine from motor endplates.\nDirect depolarization of the postjunctional motor endplate.\nIt is used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade produced by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants used during anesthesia.\nNote: Cobra venom consists of a neurotoxin that is responsible for respiratory paralysis which similar to that produced by a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. A combination of artificial respiration and neostigmine is useful in resuscitation.\nSolution to Question 26:\nAnticholinergic drugs like atropine, glycopyrrolate are routinely administered with anticholinesterases in order to attenuate the undesirable muscarinic effects.\nSolution to Question 27:\nSugammadex is used for the reversal of rocuronium.\nSugammadex is a cyclodextrin. It is the first selective relaxant binding agent. It exerts its reversal effect by forming tight complexes in a 1:1 ratio with steroidal non-depolarizing agents (rocuronium &gt; vecuronium &gt;&gt; pancuronium).\nIt is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.\nSolution to Question 28:\nNeostigmine is given postoperatively to recover from muscle weakness.\nNon-depolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs) act mainly by the competitive antagonism of nicotinic (Nm) receptors. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and inhibits the degradation of acetylcholine. The increased accumulation of undegraded acetylcholine can effectively compete with NDMRs, and thereby displace them from the site and antagonize their effects.\nInhaled Anaesthetics - Properties, N2O and Halothane\nQuestion 1:\nWhich among the following is the most potent inhaled anesthetic?\nHalothane\nIsoflurane\nDesflurane\nSevoflurane\nQuestion 2:\nAt what concentration does the administration of an inhaled general anesthetic prevent movement in response to noxious stimuli in 50% of the population?\nMaximum anesthetic concentration\nMinimum anesthetic concentration\nMaximum alveolar concentration\nMinimum alveolar concentration\nQuestion 3:\nWhat does the blood-gas partition coefficient of an inhaled anesthetic indicate?\nDuration of action\nPotency\nSolubility in blood\nSolubility in lipid\nQuestion 4:\nWhich anesthetic agent has the least solubility in blood?\nNitrous oxide\nDesflurane\nXenon\nMethoxyflurane\nQuestion 5:\nWhat is the rationale for choosing an inhaled anesthetic with the lowest MAC value?\nFastest induction and recovery\nHighest potency\nSlowest inducton and recovery\nLowest potency\nQuestion 6:\nAccording to Meyer Overton rule, which of the following is related to the potency of an anesthetic?\nSolubility in blood\nSolubility in lipid\nBlood- gas partition coefficient\nMinimum Alveolar Concentration\nQuestion 7:\nAt what concentration does the administration of an inhaled general anesthetic prevent movement in response to noxious stimuli in 50% of the population?",

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe most potent inhaled anesthetic among the given options is halothane, with a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value of 0.75%.\nThe least potent inhaled anesthetic is nitrous oxide with a MAC value of 104%.\nNote: Methoxyflurane has a MAC of 0.16%, making it more potent than halothane. However, it is obsolete now. The most potent agent overall is methoxyflurane and the most potent agent in clinical use is halothane.\nSolution to Question 2:\nMinimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is the inhaled anesthetic concentration required to prevent movement in response to noxious stimuli in 50% of patients.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe blood gas (B:G) partition coefficient of an inhaled anesthetic is an indicator of solubility in blood which determines the speed of induction and recovery.\nAn inhalational anesthetic with a lower blood gas partition (B:G) coefficient would have lower solubility in blood. This would mean a higher alveolar concentration which will lead to faster induction and recovery.\n\nXenon with a blood-gas partition coefficient of 0.115 has the fastest induction and emergence from anesthesia.\nMethoxyflurane with a blood gas partition coefficient of 12 has the slowest induction and emergence from anesthesia.\nThe speed of induction and emergence:\nXenon &gt; Desflurane &gt; Sevoflurane&gt; Isoflurane &gt; Enflurane &gt; Halothane &gt;\nMethoxyflurane\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe anesthetic agent, least soluble in the blood is xenon with a blood:gas partition coefficient of 0.115\nThe speed of induction and emergence:\nXenon &gt; Desflurane &gt; Sevoflurane &gt; Isoflurane &gt; Enflurane &gt; Halothane &gt;\nMethoxyflurane\nSolution to Question 5:\nA drug with the lowest MAC would have the highest potency.\nThe minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) value of an inhaled anesthetic is a measure of the potency of the anesthetic agent.\nLeast potent: nitrous oxide (MAC-104%). 1 MAC with nitrous oxide is practically impossible and thus it is always combined with other agents.\nMost potent: methoxyflurane (MAC-0.16%) &gt; trilene (MAC-0.2%), both of which are obsolete now.\nAmong the inhaled agents in clinical use, halothane is the most potent.\nSolution to Question 6:\nMeyer Overton rule relates potency of an anesthetic to the solubility in lipid.\nThis rule suggests that anesthesia occurs when a sufficient number of inhalational anesthetic molecules dissolve in the lipid cell membrane.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) decreases by 6% per decade for inhalational anesthetics. This is due to altered sensitivity in the ion channels and receptors (nicotinic, acetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA).\nRecovery with a volatile anesthetic in geriatric patients may be prolonged because of an increased volume of distribution(increased body fat) and decreased pulmonary gas exchange.\nDosage requirements for local and general (MAC) anesthetics are reduced in elderly patients. Administration of a given volume of epidural or spinal anesthetic results in a more extensive spread and longer duration in elderly patients.\nSolution to Question 8:\nMinimum alveolar concentration (MAC) decreases in pregnancy and hypercalcemia. Thus, these patients require a lower dose of inhalational anesthetic agents.\nChronic alcoholics, infants, and people with a history of cocaine abuse would require higher doses of anesthetic agents.\nSolution to Question 9:\nDiffusion hypoxia is observed in anesthesia during recovery from nitrous oxide anesthesia.\nDue to low solubility (low blood gas partition coefficient), N2O diffuses from the blood to the alveoli and replaces the oxygen. This reduces alveolar O2 concentration, resulting in relative hypoxemia.\nDiffusion hypoxia can be avoided by using 100% oxygen for 10 minutes during recovery from anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given color code of a blue cylinder indicates that the gas present inside the cylinder is nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide increases cerebral metabolic rate.\nNitrous oxide increases cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral oxygen consumption, and cerebral blood flow. Hence it is not preferred in neuro anesthesia as it increases intracranial pressure.\nOption A: N2O has a MAC value of 104%, which makes it the least potent inhaled anesthetic. Hence it is always used in combination with the more potent volatile agents.\nOption B: N2O has low blood-gas solubility resulting in phenomena such as second gas effect, concentration\u2013effect, and diffusion hypoxia.\nOption D: N2O acts as an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are excitatory receptors in the brain.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe image shows a pneumothorax. The inhalational agent to be avoided is nitrous oxide.\nNitrous oxide has the potential to expand air-containing cavities, as it can diffuse into and accumulate in them. Hence it should be avoided in patients with pneumothorax.\nSolution to Question 12:\nAs the sole agent, nitrous oxide can be used with oxygen for dental analgesia. It can also be used for obstetric analgesia.\nAll the other conditions are contraindications to nitrous oxide because it has the potential to expand air-containing cavities, as it can diffuse into and accumulate in them. This increases the pressure within the cavity which can lead to deleterious effects.\nSolution to Question 13:\nNitrous oxide does not undergo any metabolism in our body.\nMethoxyflurane undergoes maximum metabolism while desflurane undergoes minimal metabolism.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe peripheral smear shows macro-ovalocytes and Cabot cells, suggesting megaloblastic anemia. Nitrous oxide should not be used in a patient with megaloblastic anemia.\nN\u25a0O can cause a subclinical B12 deficiency to become overt, leading to subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACD).\nN\u25a0O inhibits vitamin B12 dependent enzymes like methionine synthetase which is essential for the formation of myelin. It also inhibits vitamin B12 dependent enzymes like thymidylate synthetase, which are necessary for DNA synthesis. This leads to the megaloblastic bone marrow changes.\nSide effects of N\u25a0O:\nBone marrow depression\nMegaloblastic anemia \u2013 may be seen following nitrous oxide exposure for 2- 6 hours\nTeratogenicity\nPeripheral neuropathy\nSolution to Question 15:\nHalothane must not be given to patients with unexplained liver dysfunction following previous anesthetic exposure due to the risk of halothane-induced hepatitis.\nHalothane-induced hepatitis is immune-mediated due to antibodies against highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride which is a metabolite of halothane.\nIt is rare with an incidence of 1 per 35,000 cases but very fatal, with a mortality of 50-75%. Risk factors for halothane hepatitis:\nMultiple exposures to halothane at short intervals\nMiddle-aged obese women- halothane undergoes extensive metabolism in obese patients\nFamilial predisposition to halothane hepatitis\nThe liver in halothane hepatitis shows centrilobular necrosis.\nSolution to Question 16:\nSevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice in a patient with a prior history of halothane hepatitis.\nUnlike the other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane is oxidized to form a stable metabolite that does not covalently bind to proteins and cause hepatic injury.\nHalothane hepatitis is immune-mediated due to antibodies against highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride which is a metabolite of halothane.\nLike halothane, other agents like isoflurane, desflurane, and enflurane also undergo metabolism to produce highly reactive intermediates that can covalently modify hepatic proteins and cause severe hepatitis.\nSolution to Question 17:\nHalothane is not contraindicated in asthmatics. In fact, it is suitable for induction in asthmatic patients due to its ability to cause bronchodilation.\nHowever, the agent of choice in asthmatics would be sevoflurane due to the low safety profile of halothane. Halothane sensitizes the heart to the effects of adrenaline and causes bradycardia and arrhythmias. An overall cardiovascular and respiratory depression is seen with Halothane which are less likely with sevoflurane.\nOption A: Halothane produces the maximum decrease in cardiac output among the inhalational anesthetics by a combination of decreased heart rate and depressed myocardial contractility.\nOption B: Halothane sensitizes the heart to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine and hence is contraindicated in pheochromocytoma.\nOption C: Inhaled anesthetics like halothane, methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane are known to trigger malignant hyperthermia.\nSolution to Question 18:\nHalothane is not metabolized to fluoride under normal circumstances.\nThe renal toxicity of volatile anesthetics is due to their metabolic breakdown to free fluoride ions. Methoxyflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane liberate fluoride compounds.\nThe amount of fluoride ions produced (in micromoles):\nMethoxyflurane &gt; Sevoflurane &gt; Enflurane &gt; Isoflurane = Desflurane\nMethoxyflurane is the most nephrotoxic among inhalational anesthetics. It causes polyuric renal failure due to a large amount of inorganic fluoride released, and it is no longer used in clinical practice.\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe given findings are suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Halothane is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma.\nPheochromocytoma is a catecholamine secreting tumor of chromaffin origin. Halothane sensitizes the heart to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine.\nOther anesthetic drugs to be avoided in a patient with pheochromocytoma are:\nSuccinylcholine - causes fasciculations which lead to raised intraabdominal pressure and catecholamine release from the tumor\nKetamine - sympathomimetic\nPancuronium - vagal blockade leading to tachycardia\nAtracurium, tubocurarine - histamine release which may provoke catecholamine release\nSolution to Question 20:\nHalothane induces bradycardia and causes the maximum reduction in cardiac output, as it blunts the baroreceptor reflex and depresses myocardial contractility.\nNormally, hypotension inhibits baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, causing a decrease in vagal stimulation and a compensatory rise in heart rate.\nHalothane and enflurane produce a greater decrease in myocardial contractility than isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane which preserve the baroreceptor reflexes and produce tachycardia in response to a fall in arterial pressure.\nCardiac output is best preserved with isoflurane. Though it produces some myocardial depression, reflex tachycardia maintains cardiac output, isoflurane is the agent of choice in cardiac patients.\nSolution to Question 21:\nMaximum decline in hepatic blood flow is caused by halothane.\nAll volatile anesthetics decrease hepatic blood flow but halothane causes the maximum\ndecrease. Hepatic artery vasoconstriction and increase in hepatic arterial resistance are seen with halothane.\nHalothane also reduces hepatic oxygen delivery and hepatic venous oxygen saturation. This is because of the greater reduction in cardiac output caused by halothane than the other volatile agents.\nHepatic arterial buffer response(HABF) is an autoregulatory mechanism in the liver. When portal blood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial blood flow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow. Halothane disrupts this regulatory mechanism, which is best preserved with sevoflurane or isoflurane.\nDesflurane and sevoflurane have the least significant effects on total hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery. Sevoflurane is considered equal to or better than isoflurane in preserving hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic oxygen delivery.\nSolution to Question 22:\nUterine relaxation is maximum with halothane.\nAlthough halothane is not used in cases of PPH, it is the only anesthetic agent that can inhibit uterine contraction.\nHence among the given inhaled drugs, Halothane is the appropriate answer for the given clinical scenario.\nHalogenated anesthetics like halothane have potent relaxant effects on the uterus. It is utilized for facilitating intrauterine fetal manipulation.\nHowever, its use during labor can prolong delivery and increase uterine bleeding.\nOptions A and B: Ether and chloroform do not have any significant uterine relaxant action.\nOption C: Nitrous oxide also has uterine relaxant properties but is less than that of halogenated inhalational anesthetics.\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe second gas effect is seen with nitrous oxide, during induction. Second gas refers to oxygen and other volatile anesthetic agents.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe incidence of halothane hepatitis is 1 in 35,000, but it is very fatal with a mortality of 50-75%.\nIt is an immune-mediated reaction due to antibodies against highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride which is a metabolite of halothane.\nRisk factors for halothane hepatitis:\nMultiple exposures to halothane at short intervals\nMiddle-aged obese women\nFamilial predisposition to halothane\nThe liver in halothane hepatitis shows centrilobular necrosis.\nSolution to Question 25:\nNitrous oxide inhibits vitamin B12 dependent enzymes like thymidylate synthetase, which is necessary for DNA synthesis \u2013 this is responsible for the megaloblastic bone marrow changes.\nMegaloblastic anemia is seen with nitrous oxide especially when exposure is greater than 2-6 hours (in healthy patients prolonged periods of exposure &gt; 12 hours is required whereas, in critically ill patients, much shorter periods of exposure can lead to megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow).\nSide effects of nitrous oxide:\nBone marrow depression\nSubacute combined degeneration of the cord\nTeratogenicity\nPeripheral neuropathy Contraindications of nitrous oxide:\nVenous or arterial air embolism\nPneumothorax\nAcute intestinal obstruction with bowel distention\nIntracranial air (pneumocephalus following dural closure or pneumoencephalography)\nPulmonary air cysts\nIntraocular air bubbles\nTympanic membrane graftin\nInhaled Anaesthetics - Fluorinated Agents, Inert Agents and Therapeutic Gases\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following inhaled anesthetics is the induction agent of choice in a patient planned for surgery under GA?\nHalothane\nSevoflurane\nDesflurane\nNitrous oxide\nQuestion 2:\nA 7-year-old boy is posted for laparoscopic appendectomy.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nSevoflurane is the induction agent of choice among inhalational anesthetics.\nIt is non-pungent and has low blood-gas solubility (0.65), allowing for smooth induction of anesthesia.\nOption A: Halothane has high blood gas solubility, leading to a slower induction of anesthesia.\nOption C: Desflurane and isoflurane are airway irritants, of which desflurane is the most pungent inhalational agent. Hence, they are not used for the induction of anesthesia as they can precipitate laryngospasm. These agents are used only during the maintenance of anesthesia.\nOption D: N2O has a MAC value of 104%, which makes it the least potent inhaled anesthetic. It is always used in combination with more potent volatile agents.\nSolution to Question 2:\nSevoflurane is preferred for induction as it is the agent of choice in pediatric anesthesia.\nOption A: Although both halothane and sevoflurane provide a smooth induction, sevoflurane appears to have a greater therapeutic index than halothane and hence is the preferred agent for inhaled induction in pediatric anesthesia.\nOptions B and D: Isoflurane and desflurane are airway irritants. Hence they are not used for induction of anesthesia as they can precipitate laryngospasm. These agents are used only during the maintenance of anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 3:\nDesflurane has the maximum global warming potential (GWP) among inhaled anesthetics.\nGlobal warming potential of Anesthetic Gases: Nitrous oxide &lt; Isoflurane &lt; Sevoflurane\n&lt; Desflurane (maximum)\nXenon produces no greenhouse effect or ozone depletion as it is entirely unreactive in the biosphere.\nAlthough the GWP factor of desflurane is much higher than that of nitrous oxide, the\nlatter contributes the most to increased climate impact (99.97%) as the consumption volumes of N2O far exceed those of other anesthetic gases.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe inhalational agent of choice for neurosurgery in patients with elevated intracranial pressure (intracranial tumor) is sevoflurane.\nSevoflurane best preserves the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and produces limited vasodilatation. Hence, it is the preferred volatile agent in patients with elevated ICP.\nThe order of vasodilating potency is approximately : halothane &gt; enflurane &gt; desflurane &gt;\nisoflurane &gt; sevoflurane.\nSolution to Question 5:\nEnflurane is contraindicated in patients with a known history of seizures, cerebrovascular disease, and head injuries.\nEnflurane is the most epileptogenic inhalational anesthetic. It increases seizure activity, especially in the presence of cerebral injury and hypocapnia, and results in increasing the cerebral metabolism manifold.\nBesides, enflurane increases cerebrospinal fluid secretion and decreases its absorption which is deleterious in those with poor intracranial compliance.\nSeizures have also been associated with the use of sevoflurane in high concentrations, especially in the pediatric population.\nEpileptogenic potential: enflurane &gt;&gt;&gt; sevoflurane\nSolution to Question 6:\nDesflurane is the inhalational agent of choice in the elderly as it is rapidly eliminated and undergoes minimal metabolism.\nThe amount of fluoride ion produced is only about 5 \u00b5m which is much lower than the other fluorinated agents and hence safe in elderly as they may have a compromised renal function.\nDesflurane is also the inhalational agent of choice in renal disease.\nSolution to Question 7:\nSevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for asthmatics because of its bronchodilatory effect.\nAlthough halothane produces greater bronchodilation, sevoflurane appears to have a greater therapeutic index. Halothane sensitizes the heart to adrenaline and causes cardiovascular depression, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and respiratory depression which are less likely with sevoflurane.\nSolution to Question 8:\nSevoflurane is the inhalational anesthetic agent of choice in liver cirrhosis.\nA cirrhotic liver has a compromised portal venous blood flow and hence it is essential to preserve the hepatic arterial blood flow.\nSevoflurane decreases portal vein blood flow but increases hepatic artery blood flow. Thus the total hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery are better maintained.\nAn alternative is isoflurane which may reduce hepatic arterial blood flow but maintains hepatic oxygen supply.\nSolution to Question 9:\nSeizures have been associated with the use of sevoflurane in high concentrations, especially in the pediatric population.\nEmergence from sevoflurane is associated with tonic-clonic movements suggestive of the seizure. Hence sevoflurane must be used cautiously in patients with a known history of seizure.\nThough isoflurane can cause myoclonus and EEG spiking, frank seizure activity is not seen. Note: Enflurane has the most epileptogenic potential among the inhaled anesthetics.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given clinical scenario of myocardial ischemia, hypotension, ST-segment changes, and decreased cardiac output point towards a diagnosis of coronary steal syndrome.\nIsoflurane has been associated with myocardial ischemic symptoms, particularly in scenarios where coronary perfusion pressure is compromised.\nIt dilates normal coronary arteries, which can redirect blood flow away from areas supplied by stenotic or diseased vessels, worsening ischemia in those regions. This redistribution of blood flow may contribute to hypotension, ST-segment changes, and reduced cardiac output. However, these effects are typically seen when hypotension occurs and can be mitigated by maintaining adequate coronary perfusion pressure.\nSolution to Question 11:\nDesflurane has rapid induction and recovery from anesthesia due to its low blood gas solubility.\nOption A: Desflurane is not used for induction as it is very pungent and may result in cough, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm.\nOption C: Desflurane is not environmentally safe as it has the maximum global warming potential among inhalational anesthetics. However, N2O contributes the most to increased climate\nimpact (99.97%) as the consumption volumes of N2O far exceed those of other anesthetic gases. Option D: Desflurane is 17 times more potent than nitrous oxide.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe canister contains desiccated soda lime. Desflurane undergoes degradation to produce carbon monoxide, in the presence of strong bases in dry CO2 absorbents (like desiccated soda lime).\nCO production is predominantly seen with absorbents that contain sodium or potassium hydroxide. It is seen less with barium hydroxide. The propensity for CO production correlates with the anesthetic concentration in the breathing circuit (desflurane &gt; enflurane &gt; isoflurane).\nAmsorb is a CO2 absorbent that is more inert than soda-lime and baralyme and so associated with lesser degradation of anesthetics and so less carbon monoxide production.\nSevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and halothane also undergo degradation in the presence of strong bases, but they do not produce CO.\nSolution to Question 13:\nSevoflurane reacts with strong bases like sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide present in soda-lime and baralyme leading to the formation of a haloalkene\n(fluoromethyl-2,2-difluoro-1-[trifluoromethyl] vinyl ether) known as compound A. Compound A has the potential to cause proximal tubular necrosis.\nRisk factors for increased compound A production:\nProlonged duration of anesthesia\nHigh concentration of sevoflurane\nLow flow techniques\nDry baralyme\nA fresh gas flow of at least 2L/ min can prevent the generation of compound A\nAmsorb is a CO2 absorbent that is more inert than soda-lime and baralyme and so associated with lesser degradation of sevoflurane and less compound A production.\nSolution to Question 14:\nXenon is non-teratogenic.\nOption A: Xenon is its high density (5.9 g/L) gas, (much higher than oxygen and nitrous oxide) which leads to increased flow resistance and work of breathing. Thus it is unsuitable for patients with compromised respiratory function.\nOption B: It has minimal cardiovascular effects. It produces minimal cardiovascular depression and is not arrhythmogenic, hence safe in cardiac patients.\nOption D: Does not trigger malignant hyperthermia\nAdvantages of xenon\nDisadvantages of xenon\nInert, Non-explosive\nHigh cost\nSafe in cardiac disease\nLow potency\nHas analgesic activity- reduce s intraoperative opioid requir ements\nHigh-density gas- higher flow resistance, poor choice for p atients with respiratory comp romise\nSolution to Question 15:\nXenon produces no greenhouse effect or ozone depletion as it is inert in the biosphere. All the other inhaled anesthetics are greenhouse gases.\nOption A: The global warming potential of nitrous oxide is about 300 times greater than carbon dioxide.\nOption B: Desflurane has the maximum global warming potential among inhaled\nanesthetics. Isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane undergo minimal metabolism in the body and are predominantly eliminated on expiration. If these are let out into the atmosphere without scavenging, they contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and global warming.\nOption D: Halothane has the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone due to its bromine-bearing molecules.\nSolution to Question 16:\nHeliox is a mixture of 70% helium and 30% oxygen.\nIt is supplied in E-size cylinders and delivered through a non-rebreathing face mask starting at a flow rate of 10L/min.\nHeliox is used in cases of partial airway obstruction as in stridor to relieve the increased work of breathing. The flow of heliox through obstruction when compared to oxygen is higher due to its density being 40% of pure oxygen. Thus it provides symptomatic relief from acute distress before definite treatment can be instituted.\nThe use of heliox in relieving lower airway obstruction as in acute asthma or COPD is unsatisfactory.\nSolution to Question 17:\nInhalation of higher oxygen concentrations can reduce the partial pressure of nitrogen inside the body.\nReduction in total body partial pressure of nitrogen provides a substantial gradient for the removal of nitrogen from gas spaces. This is beneficial in conditions such as bowel distension from obstruction of ileus, intravascular air embolism, or pneumothorax.\nOxygen is administered at greater than atmospheric pressure in hyperbaric chambers (hyperbaric oxygen).\nSolution to Question 18:\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is commonly used to flood the surgical field during cardiac surgery.\nA common cause of myocardial ischemia during open-heart surgery is air embolism to the coronary arteries.\nCarbon dioxide because of its higher density, displaces the air surrounding the open heart so that any gas bubbles trapped in the heart are of carbon dioxide (soluble) and not nitrogen (insoluble).\nSolution to Question 19:\nInhaled nitric oxide (NO) is approved (USFDA) for use in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.\nInhaled NO selectively dilates the pulmonary vasculature and has the potential to treat many conditions that result in increased pulmonary hypertension.\nSolution to Question 20:\nHalothane produces the maximum decrease in cardiac output by a combination of decreased heart rate and depressed myocardial contractility\nHalothane and enflurane produce a greater decrease in myocardial contractility than isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane which best maintain cardiac output.\nOf these, cardiac output is best preserved with isoflurane \u2013 though it does produce some myocardial depression, reflex tachycardia maintains cardiac output. Isoflurane is the agent of choice in cardiac patients.\nSolution to Question 21:\nXenon is a noble gas which is used for its anesthetic properties and it has no effect on the ozone. Other options :\nHalothane and isoflurane have the potential to destroy stratospheric ozone due to their bromine\n(halothane only) and chlorine-bearing molecules.\nThe contribution to stratospheric ozone loss by the anesthetic N2O is likely more significant, compared to halothane and isoflurane.\nSolution to Question 22:\nXenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and so produces rapid induction and emergence from anesthesia.\nOption A: the disadvantage with xenon gas is its high density (5.9 g/L), which is much higher than oxygen and nitrous oxide which leads to increased flow resistance and work of breathing. Thus it is not suitable for patients with compromised respiratory function.\nOption B: It has minimal cardiovascular effects- it produces minimal cardiovascular depression, and it is not arrhythmogenic- so safe in cardiac patients.\nOption C: Xenon produces no greenhouse effect or ozone depletion and is environmentally safe, unlike the other inhaled anesthetics.\nOther advantages of xenon:\nDoes not trigger malignant hyperthermia\nNonexplosive\nHas analgesic activity - reduces intraoperative opioid requirements\nSolution to Question 23:\nAmong the given options, isoflurane is best suited for neurosurgery.\nAll of the inhalational anesthetics are cerebral vasodilators. The order of vasodilating potency is: halothane &gt; enflurane &gt; desflurane &gt; isoflurane &gt; sevoflurane.\nNote: Due to its lesser vasodilating property, sevoflurane is preferred to isoflurane for neurosurgery.\nIntravenous Anesthesia - Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines & Propofol\nQuestion 1:\nWhat concentration of intravenous thiopentone is used to induce anesthesia in a patient?",

    "question_text": "% solution of methohexital\nSolution to Question 2:\nRapid recovery from thiopentone anesthesia is due to its rapid redistribution.\nIt is redistributed from the brain to tissues that are less perfused, like muscles, resulting in rapid recovery (within 20 minutes).\nSolution to Question 3:\nThiopentone is an alkaline solution and should not be reconstituted with Ringer's lactate which has an acidic pH. Ringer's lactate decreases the alkalinity of the solution and the calcium present in it can result in the precipitation of thiopentone.\nThiopentone and other barbiturates are prepared as sodium salts (mixed with 6% by weight anhydrous sodium carbonate) and can be reconstituted with water, 5% glucose, or normal saline to produce a 2.5% solution of thiopental.\nAfter reconstitution:\nThiobarbiturates (thiopentone, thiamylal) \u2013 stable if refrigerated for 1 week\nMethohexital \u2013 stable if refrigerated for 6 weeks\nSolution to Question 4:\nThiopentone can be safely administered in a patient with raised intracranial tension, i.e., brain tumor.\nThiopentone is cerebroprotective as it reduces CSF volume by facilitating its absorption. It also decreases cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and helps in lowering intracranial pressure.\nThe other options are contraindications to the use of thiopentone.\nOption B: Thiopentone induces aminolevulinic acid synthetase, which increases the formation of porphyrins. This precipitate porphyria attacks, especially acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria in susceptible individuals.\nOption C: Thiopentone should be avoided in hypovolemic or shock patients because of the significant reduction in cardiac output (69%) and arterial blood pressure due to vasodilation and venous pooling.\nOption D: Thiopentone produces dose-related central respiratory depression, producing a characteristic ventilatory pattern called 'double apnea'.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThiopentone has a rapid onset of action due to the high unionized fraction and high lipid solubility.\nOnly the unionized form can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert its action (within 30 s).\nRapid redistribution is responsible for the termination of action of thiopentone. i.e., it governs the duration of the action, not the onset.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThiopentone does not produce analgesia and may even produce anti-analgesia by reducing the pain threshold.\nOption A: Thiopentone has a rapid onset of action (within 30 s) due to high lipid solubility and a high unionized fraction (60%). It has an ultra-short duration of action (within 20 mins) due to rapid redistribution.\nOption C: Thiopentone does not completely suppress airway responses to laryngoscopy and intubation and may lead to bronchospasm in asthmatics.\nOption D: Thiopentone is cerebroprotective as it reduces CSF volume by facilitating its absorption. It decreases cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume, thus lowering intracranial pressure. It also has an anticonvulsant property which is advantageous in neurosurgical patients who are at increased risk of seizures.\nSolution to Question 7:\nIntravenous methohexital is the agent of choice for providing anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nMethohexital can induce seizures and has a rapid recovery. It is also useful in identifying epileptic foci during surgery for resistant seizures.\nNote: According to Mental Health Care Act (MHCA) 2017, ECT should be performed only after administering a short-acting general anesthetic along with muscle relaxants. This method is known as modified ECT.\nSolution to Question 8:\nPhenobarbitone is not completely eliminated by the liver. 25% to 50% of the drug is excreted by the kidneys in an unchanged form.\nAll barbiturates (thiopentone, thiamylal, methohexital) other than phenobarbitone are completely eliminated by the liver.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe imaging suggests an extradural hemorrhage (EDH). Thiopentone is preferred for induction of anesthesia in head injury.\nThiopentone is cerebroprotective, as it decreases cerebral blood flow (CBF), thus lowering intracranial pressure (ICP). It reduces cerebral oxygen consumption (decreased CMRO2). It also has an anticonvulsant property which is advantageous in neurosurgical patients who are at increased risk of seizures.\nCBF\nICP\nCMR O2\nSeizu re\nThiopenton e\n\uf0af\uf0af\uf0af\n\uf0af\uf0af\uf0af\n\uf0af\uf0af\uf0af\n\uf0af\uf0af\uf0af\nKetamine\n\uf0ad\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\nHalothane\n\uf0ad\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\uf0ad\n\uf0af\n\uf0af\nNitrous oxi de\n\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\n\uf0ad\n\uf0af\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given clinical features of severe pain with burning sensation and cyanosis of fingers point to accidental intra-arterial administration of thiopentone. Saline administration via the same needle to dilute the drug should be the first step in managing this case.\nIntra-arterial injection of thiopentone can form crystals in the arterioles and capillaries, causing severe vasoconstriction, thrombosis and even gangrene. The degree of gangrene corresponds to the concentration of the drug.\nTreatment:\nThe needle should not be removed as it can aggravate vasospasm\nSaline administered via the same needle to dilute the drug\nHeparin to prevent thrombosis\nPapaverine and lidocaine\nBrachial plexus block or stellate ganglion block to relieve vasospasm\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe main goal of premedication is to diminish anxiety.\nPreoperative medication may also provide relief of preoperative pain or perioperative amnesia. Indications for preoperative medication:\nProphylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting (5-HT3s)\nProphylaxis against aspiration pneumonia (eg, antacids)\nPrevention of allergic reactions (eg, antihistamines)\nDecreasing upper airway secretions (eg, anticholinergics)\nSome medications that are given preoperatively (e.g., opioids) decrease anaesthetic requirements and can cause smooth induction.\nSolution to Question 12:\nHistamine release is more commonly seen with barbiturates like thiopental and\nmethohexital. Hence thiopental should be avoided in patients with bronchial asthma to prevent wheezing.\nBarbiturates increase histamine release from mast cells and produce a higher incidence of wheezing when compared to propofol.\nNote: Thiopental and methohexital are ultra-short acting barbiturates indicated for the induction of anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe shortest-acting benzodiazepine among the given options is midazolam. It is administered as a pre-medication in children having separation anxiety before procedures or in short procedures requiring sedation.\nThe benzodiazepines used in anesthesia are classified according to their metabolism and plasma clearance as follows:\nUltra-short acting - Remimazolam (FDA-approved for procedural sedation\uf0a3 30 mins in adults)\nShort-acting agent - Midazolam\nIntermediate-acting agents - Lorazepam, temazepam\nLong-acting agent - Diazepam\nMidazolam is the benzodiazepine of choice for induction of anesthesia. The onset of anesthesia is within 30 to 60 seconds.\nSolution to Question 14:\nBenzodiazepines do not produce analgesia, and so, they must be used with other anesthetic drugs to provide sufficient analgesia.\nBenzodiazepines are the most commonly administered drugs for premedication. They act through GABA A receptors:\n\uf0b0 1 subunit - sedation, anterograde amnesia (retrograde memory unaffected) and anticonvulsant action\n\uf0b0 2 subunit - anxiolysis and muscle relaxation\nSolution to Question 15:\nRemimazolam is a new GABA-A receptor agonist.\nIt combines the properties of two unique drugs - midazolam and remifentanil. It acts on GABA-A receptors like midazolam and has organ independent metabolism like remifentanil.\nIt is an ultra-short-acting intravenous benzodiazepine, which is rapidly degraded in plasma by nonspecific esterases to its carboxylic acid metabolite CNS 7054.\nIt has a rapid onset of action, greater depth of sedation, and more rapid recovery than with midazolam.\nSolution to Question 16:\nLorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used for induction of anesthesia at a dose of 0.1mg/kg, although midazolam is preferred among benzodiazepines.\nBenzodiazepines are mainly used for sedation and less commonly for induction of anesthesia due to the availability of better induction agents (propofol, etomidate, ketamine, and thiopentone).\nDexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 agonist and is used primarily as an adjuvant. So, a better option would be lorazepam.\nSolution to Question 17:\nFlumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist approved for clinical use to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines.\nIt is a competitive reversible antagonist at the benzodiazepine receptor with high affinity and specificity.\nFlumazenil is used for both diagnostic and therapeutic reversal of benzodiazepine receptor agonists.\nSolution to Question 18:\nPropofol is not contraindicated in egg allergy patients.\nPropofol is formulated as an oil-in-water emulsion, which contains soybean oil, glycerol, and egg lecithin. Usually, egg allergies are a reaction to egg white (egg albumin). But, propofol contains egg lecithin, which is extracted from egg yolk, and so, propofol is not necessarily contraindicated in patients with a history of egg allergy.\nPropofol has been associated with life-threatening systemic infections because it decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, but not adherence phagocytosis and killing. It inhibits phagocytosis and killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.\nPropofol is associated with hypertriglyceridemia which can predispose to pancreatitis.\nIt has antiemetic properties which help in reducing the incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting.\nSolution to Question 19:\nBacterial contamination of vials is a risk with propofol.\nPropofol formulations contain egg lecithin and soyabean oil. The egg is a good medium for bacterial growth and the lack of preservatives supports the growth of bacteria which can lead to sepsis or even death.\nHence, propofol must be used within 6 hours of opening the ampule.\nNowadays, certain additives like 0.005% disodium edetate or 0.025% sodium metabisulfite have been added to propofol formulations so as to retard the rate of growth of microorganisms.\nSolution to Question 20:\nPropofol has antipruritic properties. It can also relieve cholestatic pruritus and may be as effective as naloxone in treating pruritus induced by spinal opiates.\nOption A: Propofol produces a 25% to 40% reduction in systolic blood pressure following injection.\nOption C: Propofol is formulated as a lipid emulsion that causes pain during injection. This can be decreased by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, prior injection of lidocaine or by mixing lidocaine with propofol prior to injection (2 mL of 1% lidocaine in 18 mL propofol).\nOption D: Propofol produces maximum inhibition of airway reflexes and can facilitate intubation, endoscopy, or laryngeal mask placement without neuromuscular blockade.\nSolution to Question 21:\nFospropofol is a water-soluble prodrug of propofol that has a slower onset and slower recovery than propofol. It is hydrolyzed to propofol, phosphate, and formaldehyde.\nFospropofol is advantageous since it is not associated with pain on injection.\nFospropofol is approved for sedation during local and regional anesthesia e.g., conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care. Due to its slower onset of sedation, it is associated with a lower incidence of hypotension, respiratory depression, apnea, and loss of airway patency.\nSolution to Question 22:\nPropofol is an intravenous induction agent that can be addictive because of its hypnotic property and development of tolerance on prolonged use.\nThe abuse potential is common among health care workers with reports of self-administration. There is only a narrow therapeutic window between the hypnotic, euphoric effect of propofol and its lethal dose. When exceeded, it can cause airway obstruction, respiratory depression, hypoxia or an unstable hemodynamic response leading to death.\nNote: Ketamine also has the potential for abuse and addiction.\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe given features point towards a diagnosis of propofol infusion syndrome. It is a rare but lethal syndrome seen when the dose of propofol infusion is &gt; 4 mg/kg/hour for 48 hours or longer.\nThis syndrome is common in children and critically ill adults. Clinical features:\nAcute refractory bradycardia leading to asystole in the presence of one or more of the following:\nMetabolic acidosis (base deficit &gt;10 mmol/L)\nRhabdomyolysis\nHyperlipidemia\nEnlarged or fatty live\nOther features - cardiomyopathy with acute cardiac failure, skeletal myopathy, hyperkalemia, hepatomegaly, and lipemia.\nThe symptoms and signs are the results of muscle injury and the release of intracellular toxic contents. It is due to defect in mitochondrial metabolism and electron transport chain function.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of acute pancreatitis, which can be predisposed by the administration of propofol.\nPropofol has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, which may predispose the patient to pancreatitis.\nRisk factors for propofol-induced hypertriglyceridemia:\nOld age\nLonger ICU stay\nReceived propofol for a longer duration.\nIt is essential to monitor serum triglyceride levels when propofol is used for a prolonged duration or at higher infusion rates (especially in older patients).\nSolution to Question 25:\nPropofol infusion syndrome is associated with rhabdomyolysis which leads to hyperkalemia.\nPropofol infusion syndrome is a rare but lethal syndrome due to a defect in mitochondrial metabolism and electron transport chain function. It is seen when the dose of propofol infusion is greater than 4mg/kg/hour for 48 hours or longer.\nClinical features:\nAcute refractory bradycardia leading to asystole in the presence of one or more of the following:\nMetabolic acidosis (base deficit &gt;10 mmol/L)\nRhabdomyolysis\nHyperlipidemia\nEnlarged or fatty live\nOther features - cardiomyopathy with acute cardiac failure, skeletal myopathy, hyperkalemia, hepatomegaly, and lipemia.\nSolution to Question 26:\nRobin Hood or reverse steal phenomenon is seen with thiopentone.\nThiopentone constricts the cerebral vasculature, causing a decrease in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intracranial pressure. However, this vasoconstriction occurs only in normal areas. The blood vessels in the ischemic area remain dilated due to ischemia-induced vasomotor paralysis and are unaffected by thiopentone. This leads to redistribution of blood flow from normal to ischemic areas in the brain. This is called the Robin Hood phenomenon.\nSolution to Question 27:\nTotal intravenous anesthesia results in reduced cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow. The most commonly used agent is propofol.\nAdvantages of TIVA over inhaled anesthetics:\nSmooth induction and rapid recovery with a minimal hangove\nLow incidence of nausea and vomiting\nSafe in patients susceptible to malignant hyperpyrexia\nReduced greenhouse effect of inhalational anesthesia\nParalysis is not always required, reversal agents can be avoided and emergence is rapid\n(especially in propofol TIVA with remifentanil).\nSolution to Question 28:\nHalothane is an inhalational agent which is a halogenated alkane. Induction with halothane is relatively slow due to its high blood: gas partition coefficient (2.5).\nIntravenous induction agents:\nPropofol is the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic.\nThiopentone is the intravenous agent of choice to provide cerebral protection.\nEtomidate is the intravenous agent of choice to maintain cardiovascular stability in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and cerebral vascular disease.\nKetamine is the intravenous agent of choice in asthmatics.\nIntravenous Anesthesia - Etomidate, Ketamine and Daycare Surgery\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following agents does not elicit pain on injection?\nKetamine\nPropofo\nEtomidate\nThiopentone\nQuestion 2:\nWhich is the most epileptogenic intravenous induction agent?\nThiopentone\nEtomidate\nKetamine\nPropofo\nQuestion 3:\nWhich intravenous anesthetic has the maximum incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting?\nThiopentone\nKetamine\nEtomidate\nPropofo\nQuestion 4:\nWhich of the following is true regarding etomidate?\nReduces postoperative nausea and vomiting\nHas been used to treat hypercortisolemia\nContraindicated in coronary artery disease\nAvoided in neurosurgical procedures due to risk of raised ICP\nQuestion 5:\nWhich of the following drugs is the intravenous induction agent of choice in a patient with a history of myocardial infarction?\nEtomidate\nThiopentone\nPropofo\nKetamine\nQuestion 6:\nWhich intravenous anesthetic is associated with adreno-cortical suppression?\nThiopentone\nPropofo\nEtomidate\nKetamine\nQuestion 7:\nIn the immediate post-operative period, a patient has persistent hiccups and myoclonus.

What is the intravenous agent of choice for induction in him?\nPropofo\nThiopentone\nKetamine\nEtomidate\nQuestion 13:\nA patient in hemorrhagic shock was shifted for emergency surgery and given ketamine for induction. Why is this drug preferred for use in this situation?\nDirect sympathomimetic action\nIndirect sympathomimetic action\nNegative inotropic action\nPositive inotropic action\nQuestion 14:\nWhich of the following is a true statement about ketamine?\nProduces pain on injection\nContraindicated in asthmatic patients\nSafe in hyperthyroidism\nProduces salivation and lacrimation\nQuestion 15:\nAn adolescent boy with bronchial asthma is about to undergo an emergency appendectomy.

    "question_text": "\nc\nSolution to Question 1:\nKetamine does not elicit pain on injection, instead produces profound analgesia.\nPropofol is formulated as a lipid emulsion, which causes pain on injection. A new aqueous prodrug, fospropofol is associated with less pain on injection.\nEtomidate, although it causes pain on injection, the lipid formulation of etomidate is associated with a much less frequent incidence of pain.\nThiopentone at a concentration greater than 2.5% can produce pain on injection and venous thrombosis.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe most epileptogenic intravenous induction agent is etomidate.\nEtomidate has been associated with grand mal seizures and produces increased EEG activity in epileptogenic foci. This feature has proven useful for intraoperative mapping of seizure foci before surgical ablation.\nThiopentone and propofol have anticonvulsant properties which are advantageous in neurosurgical patients who are at increased risk of seizures.\nKetamine has a mixed effect on seizure activity, with either strong pro-convulsant or strong anticonvulsant action.\nSolution to Question 3:\nEtomidate has the highest incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) among intravenous anesthetics.\nPropofol has antiemetic properties thereby reducing PONV. Other potential adverse effects of etomidate:\nAdrenocortical suppression\nMyoclonus\nSeizure precipitation\nPain on injection\nSolution to Question 4:\nEtomidate can be used in the treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia. This is due to its ability to inhibit the enzyme 11\uf062-hydroxylase, which results in decreased biosynthesis of cortisol.\nEtomidate has the highest incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nEtomidate is the most cardiac stable induction agent and is the agent of choice in coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and cerebral vascular disease.\nEtomidate can be safely used in neurosurgical procedures. It is also the anaesthetic induction agent of choice to reduce increased ICP when maintenance of cerebral or coronary perfusion pressure is important.\nSolution to Question 5:\nAs the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, the agent of choice is etomidate.\nEtomidate is the most cardiac stable intravenous agent due to its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and baroreceptor function.\nThe myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. It is the IV induction agent of choice in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and cerebral vascular disease.\nAdverse effects of etomidate:\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)\nMyoclonus\nAdrenocortical suppression\nEpileptogenic potentia\nOption B: Thiopentone decreases the cardiac output, systemic arterial pressure, and peripheral vascular resistance.\nOption C: Propofol produces cardiovascular depression by direct myocardial depressant effects and decreases systemic vascular resistance.\nOption D: Ketamine produces an increase in arterial pressure, heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand.\nSolution to Question 6:\nEtomidate has been associated with adrenocortical suppression which can last for 72 hours.\nEtomidate inhibits the enzyme 11\uf062-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased biosynthesis of cortisol and mineralocorticoids and increases the formation of intermediaries like 11-deoxycorticosterone.\nIt is a more potent inhibitor of steroid synthesis than as a sedative-hypnotic as the concentration which produces adrenocortical suppression (10 ng/mL)is much lower than that needed for hypnosis (&gt;200 ng/mL).\nSolution to Question 7:\nEtomidate has a very high incidence of myoclonus and hiccups.\nThe possible cause of myoclonus is thought to be subcortical disinhibition, and not due to epileptogenic foci.\nThis myoclonus can be minimized by premedication with benzodiazepines (midazolam) or opiates or a small dose of magnesium 60 to 90 seconds before administering etomidate.\nPotential adverse effects of etomidate:\nAdrenocortical suppression\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting\nSeizure precipitation\nMyoclonus, hiccups\nPain on injection\nSolution to Question 8:\nKetamine is avoided in head injury patients as it increases cerebral oxygen consumption\n(CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and intracranial pressure (ICP).\nEtomidate, propofol and thiopentone decrease CMRO2, CBF and ICP.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe main site of action of ketamine is the thalamoneocortical projection system.\nIt inhibits certain parts of the cortex (especially association areas) and thalamus but stimulates parts of the limbic system, including the hippocampus.\nKetamine is an antagonist at the excitatory glutamatergic NMDA receptor. The NMDA receptor is highly expressed in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given features suggest dissociative anaesthesia, which is a characteristic feature of ketamine.\nKetamine produces dissociative anesthesia which is characterized by a state wherein the patient is conscious (eg., eye opening, swallowing, muscle contracture) but unable to process or respond to sensory input.\nKetamine functionally \u201cdissociates\u201d the thalamus (which relays sensory impulses from the reticular activating system to the cerebral cortex) from the limbic cortex (which is involved with the awareness of sensation). It acts as an antagonist at the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor.\nSolution to Question 11:\nKetamine produces dissociative anesthesia through antagonistic action at the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor.\nDissociative anesthesia is a state where the patient appears conscious (eye-opening, swallowing, muscle contracture) but unable to process or respond to sensory input.\nKetamine functionally \u201cdissociates\u201d the thalamus, which relays sensory impulses from the reticular activating system to the cerebral cortex from the limbic cortex involved with the perception of sensation.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe clinical features suggest circulatory failure. The IV induction agent of choice in hypotensive patients is ketamine &gt; etomidate.\nKetamine helps to maintain arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output by central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. It also increases peripheral arteriolar resistance and reduces redistribution of hypothermia in hypovolemic patients.\nKetamine is avoided in patients with hypertension as it raises the blood pressure.\nOption A: Propofol produces cardiovascular depression by direct myocardial depressant effects and decreases systemic vascular resistance, which is more profound than thiopentone.\nOption B: Thiopentone decreases cardiac output, systemic arterial pressure, and peripheral vascular resistance.\nOption D: Etomidate is primarily used in Neurosurgery as it decreases Intracranial pressure but despite its favorable hemodynamic profile, it causes arterial hypotension in the volume-depleted patient.\nSolution to Question 13:\nKetamine is preferred due to its indirect sympathomimetic action. It is the intravenous anesthetic of choice for hemorrhagic shock.\nIt inhibits the reuptake of both central and peripheral catecholamines and causes increased blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output.\nKetamine has direct negative inotropic and vasodilating activity, but these effects are overwhelmed by the indirect sympathomimetic action.\nSolution to Question 14:\nKetamine administration may be associated with salivation and lacrimation which can be attenuated by premedication with an anticholinergic agent such as glycopyrrolate.\nOption A: Ketamine does not elicit pain on injection.\nOption B: Ketamine is the induction agent of choice in asthmatic patients as it is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant.\nOption C: Ketamine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and so is best avoided in patients with hyperthyroidism because of the possibility of exaggerated elevations in blood pressure and heart rate.\nSolution to Question 15:\nIn an actively wheezing asthmatic patient, ketamine is the induction agent of choice, as it is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant.\nIt is also the drug of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients.\nPropofol is the intravenous induction agent of choice for the hemodynamically stable asthmatic patient, who is not actively wheezing. Both drugs possess good bronchodilatory action.\nSolution to Question 16:\nA rise in intraocular pressure is seen with ketamine.\nHence, ketamine may be contraindicated in patients with an open eye injury or other ophthalmologic disorder, in which an increase in intraocular pressure would be detrimental.\nSolution to Question 17:\nAirway reflexes are best preserved with ketamine.\nCorneal, cough and swallow reflexes all may be present, but they may not be protective. So, patients at increased risk for aspiration pneumonia (\u201cfull stomachs\u201d) should be intubated during ketamine general anesthesia.\nPropofol is associated with maximum inhibition of airway reflexes.\nSolution to Question 18:\nHallucinations and vivid dreams during recovery from anesthesia are a manifestation of an emergence reaction following the administration of ketamine.\nThe incidence of psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100% and is usually associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. The symptoms usually appear in the first hour of\nemergence and subside within several hours.\nSolution to Question 19:\nHallucinations and vivid dreams during recovery from anesthesia are a manifestation of emergence reaction following ketamine administration.\nBenzodiazepines like midazolam are the most effective group of drugs in the prevention of emergence reactions.\nSolution to Question 20:\nKetamine is the intravenous induction agent of choice in bronchial asthma and shock. Ketamine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and preserves upper airway reflexes.\nKetamine increases heart rate, arterial pressure, and cardiac output by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. It is the only anesthetic that increases peripheral arteriolar resistance and thus reduces redistribution of hypothermia in hypovolemic patients.\nContraindications of ketamine:\nRaised intracranial pressure\nOpen globe injury (raises intraocular pressure)\nVascular aneurysm surgery (possible sudden change in arterial blood pressure)\nPsychiatric diseases - schizophrenia\nHyperthyroidism (exaggerated elevations in blood pressure, heart rate)\nIschemic heart disease (increase in myocardial oxygen consumption)\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe intravenous induction agent of choice for ambulatory anesthesia is propofol.\nPropofol has a rapid onset of action and a faster recovery. This makes it an ideal induction agent for outpatient/ambulatory/day care anesthesia.\nBesides, propofol has antiemetic properties which help reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting.\nSolution to Question 22:\nRocuronium is the muscle relaxant of choice for daycare surgery.\nRocuronium is an intermediate-acting muscle relaxant with a rapid onset (90 secs).\nIts actions can be terminated by the reversal agent sugammadex, which produces a rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade.\nNote: Succinylcholine is the shortest acting muscle relaxant, but it has a high incidence of postoperative myalgia. So, its use in day care anesthesia is discouraged.\nSolution to Question 23:\nInfiltration anesthesia is given for fast-track surgery.\nAmbulatory/outpatient anesthesia employs the use of fast-track surgical techniques to provide adequate surgical anesthesia and minimize postoperative complications in order to reduce the duration of hospital stay.\nInfiltration anesthesia (inguinal field block) is ideal to perform inguinal hernia repair because it has a lesser incidence of complications than regional or general anesthesia.\nThe disadvantage of infiltration anesthesia is its short duration of anesthesia even when long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine are used.\nSolution to Question 24:\nDrowsiness is the most common adverse effect that persists after discharge following an ambulatory or daycare anesthesia.\nAdverse effects after ambulatory anesthesia in their decreasing order of incidence:\nDrowsiness\nSore-throat\nMyalgia\nHeadache, dizziness\nNausea, vomiting\nCardiovascular - hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest (rare)\nRespiratory - hypoxemia, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, aspiration, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax (rare)\nSolution to Question 25:\nKetamine can be used to reduce postoperative pain as it produces profound analgesia. It inhibits nociceptive central hypersensitization.\nBesides, ketamine may be effective in the treatment of:\ncancer pain, visceral pain\nmigraine, chronic neuropathic pain\nphantom limb pain\nfibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome\nSolution to Question 26:\nKetamine causes hypertension due to central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. Hence, it is useful in patients in shock.\nThiopentone, propofol, and etomidate produce a fall in arterial blood pressure.\nSolution to Question 27:\nKetamine is an arylcyclohexylamine, a congener of phencyclidine.\nKetamine produces dissociative anaesthesia through antagonistic action at the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor.\nKetamine, like other phencyclidines, produces emergence reactions which are undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from anesthesia.\nLocal Anaesthetics - General Properties\nQuestion 1:\nThe main mechanism of action of lignocaine is through inhibition of \t.\nResting, voltage-gated Na channel\nInactivated, voltage-gated Na channel\nResting, ligand-gated Na channel\nInactivated, ligand-gated Na channel\nQuestion 2:\nBy what mechanism do local anesthetics block nerve conduction?\nInhibiting the release of neurotransmitter\nDecreasing the influx of sodium into the cell\nIncreasing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter\nInhibiting the efflux of sodium from neuron\nQuestion 3:\nA patient has presented to your OPD with a sebaceous cyst on the scalp. You plan to excise it. Before making the first incision, you inject lidocaine around it. Which of the following effects does this drug have?\nOnly 1",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition of inactivated, voltage-gated Na channel.\nLocal anesthesia involves the abolition of local sensation through blockade of nerve impulses. Na channels exist in 3 states:\nResting (non-conducting)\nOpen (conducting)\nInactivated (non conducting)\nLocal anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. They bind to the Na channel from the inner aspect in cationic form.\nThey bind to the \uf0b0 subunit of Na channel and inhibit the conformational changes associated with channel opening, thereby preventing Na influx. When a considerable number of Na channels are inactivated, the action potential cannot be generated and impulse cannot be propagated.\nSolution to Question 2:\nLocal anesthetics block nerve conduction by decreasing the influx of sodium ions into the cells. Normally, sodium influx is followed by slight depolarization of the membrane.\nLocal anesthetics in unionized form cross the cell membrane and are converted to ionized forms inside the cytoplasm the sodium channel blockade occurs. Resting/closed conformation of the sodium channels have relatively low affinity for local anesthetics.\nSolution to Question 3:\nLocal anesthetics inhibit potassium channels. The effects of local anesthetics include:\nInhibition of voltage-gated Na channel\nBlockade of potassium and calcium channel\nTransient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)\nInteraction with cholinergic or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\nInterference with cellular metabolic processes (eg, oxidative phosphorylation, free fatty acid utilization)\nHowever, the main action of local anesthetics is mediated by inhibition of voltage-gated Na channels.\nSolution to Question 4:\nLidocaine (lignocaine, xylocaine) is an amino-amide.\nSolution to Question 5:\nCocaine is the only amino ester that is not metabolized by plasma cholinesterases. It is partially metabolized by hepatic carboxylesterase and partially excreted unchanged in the urine.\nArticaine is the only amino amide which is inactivated by plasma esterases.\nNote: Cocaine is a vasoconstrictor due to its property of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. All the other local anaesthetics are vasodilators except cocaine.\nSolution to Question 6:\nLidocaine is an intermediate-acting local anesthetic. It is not preferred in procedures for prolonged pain relief.\nLong-acting local anesthetics are preferred for prolonged pain relief.\nBupivacaine, ropivacaine, and tetracaine are all long-acting and thus can be used to administer the brachial plexus block in this case.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most potent local anaesthetic among the following is bupivacaine followed by mepivacaine and then procaine.\nPotency depends on hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity can be increased by the addition of alkyl groups to the molecule.\nNote: Dibucaine is the most potent, most toxic and longest acting local anaesthetic agent.\nSolution to Question 8:\nAmong the given options, lidocaine has the lowest pKa value. Thus, it has the maximum amount of unionized drug at physiological pH.\nIt is the unionized form of local anesthetics that penetrate the membrane. Hence, pKa correlates with the onset of action.\npKa of a drug is the pH at which the drug is 50% ionized and 50% nonionized.\npKa values of Local Anesthetics\nChloroprocaine - 9.1\nProcaine - 8.9\nTetracaine - 8.4\nBupivacaine - 8.1\nPrilocaine - 8.0\nEtidocaine - \u02dc.9\nLidocaine - \u02dc.8\nMepivacaine - \u02dc.\u02dc\nSolution to Question 9:\nSolution to Question 10:\nEpinephrine is used along with local anesthetics at a concentration of 5 \uf06dg/mL or 1:200,000. At this dose, epinephrine provides adequate vasoconstriction.\nAdvantages of vasoconstrictors:\nIncreased duration of action\nImproved depth of anesthesia\nDecreased local anesthetic toxicity\nAs a marker for inadvertent intravascular injection\nSolution to Question 11:\nBy adding adrenaline to lidocaine, the duration of action can be increased to 2 hours.\nDrug\nMaximum dose\nDuration of actio n\nLignocaine\nPlain",

    "question_text": "240 min\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe use of a vasoconstrictors-local anesthetic combination is contraindicated in digital block (ring block). This is an area supplied by end arteries and there is a risk of ischemia and necrosis.\nThe combination of local anesthetic with a vasoconstrictor is contraindicated in:\nDigital nerve block (ring block)\nToe block\nSurgery of the tip of the nose and pinna\nSurgery of the penis (circumcision)\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetics does not reduce local anesthetic toxicity.\nAll local anesthetics are weak bases, but commercially available solutions have an acidic pH in order to maximize the stability and shelf life. In acidic solutions, most of the drug will be\nin ionized form. It is only the uncharged (non-ionized) form that diffuses across the lipid barrier to the site of action.\nA basic solution (sodium bicarbonate) can be added to a local anesthetic solution immediately before injection to raise the pH. This is termed 'alkalinization' or 'buffering'. Alkalinization increases the proportion of non-ionized drug resulting in more rapid drug diffusion.\nAdvantages of alkalinization:\nFaster onset of action\nReduced pain/stinging on subcutaneous injection\nImproved quality of the block\n1mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate is added to 10 mL of local anesthetic solution.\nExcessive sodium bicarbonate raises the pH too far and precipitates non-charged basic form in the solution.\nSolution to Question 14:\nNeurotoxicity from neuro-axial (epidural or spinal) placement of local anesthetic solution is maximum with lidocaine.\nOrder of neurotoxicity: Lidocaine = Tetracaine &gt; Bupivacaine &gt; Ropivacaine. Neurotoxicity may manifest as transient neurological symptoms or cauda equine syndrome.\nSolution to Question 15:\nLocal anesthetic-induced myotoxicity following intramuscular injection is maximum with bupivacaine.\nThe mechanism of muscle damage is due to mitochondrial damage. Toxicity is reversible as it resolves within 2 weeks.\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe manifestations of shellfish poisoning are due to the action of the poison on the outer pore of the voltage-gated sodium channel.\nShellfish poisoning is due to the neurotoxin saxitoxin and puffer fish poisoning is due to tetrodotoxin. Although these toxins are chemically distinct, they are exceedingly potent and have similar mechanisms of action.\nWhile local anesthetics inhibit sodium channel activity by binding to the inner pore (from intracellular side), these toxins bind to the outer pore of the channel. As a result, the action potential is blocked.\nUnlike local anesthetics, these neurotoxins are very specific to neuronal Na channels, hence cardiac and neurological side effects are low.\nTreatment includes gastric lavage, vasopressors. Mechanical ventilation may be required if respiratory paralysis sets in.\nPrognosis is good when the patient survives after 24 hours.\nSolution to Question 17:\nBupivacaine toxicity resulting in cardiac arrest is treated with epinephrine.\nIf cardiac arrest occurs, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) recommends standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) with the following modifications:\nIf epinephrine is used, small initial doses (10-100 \uf06dg boluses in adults) are preferable\nVasopressin is not recommended\nAvoid calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers\nIf ventricular arrhythmias develop, amiodarone is preferable",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe spray used by the pulmonologist is most likely a topical anesthetic. Bupivacaine is not used for topical anesthesia.\nLidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and dibucaine are used for topical anesthesia. Lidocaine and tetracaine topical sprays:\nEndotracheal intubation - blunt the cardiovascular responses\nEsophagoscopy, bronchoscopy - mucosal analgesia. Lidocaine patch: postherpetic neuralgia.\nBenzocaine and cetacaine (a topical application spray containing benzocaine, tetracaine, and butamben) had been used but a greater incidence of methemoglobinemia due to benzocaine has discouraged their use.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe substance applied by the anesthesia resident is EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic) which consists of a 1:1 mixture of 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine.\nA eutectic mixture has a melting point lesser than the individual drugs and hence the mixture is in the oil form at room temperature.\nEMLA can provide adequate dermal analgesia for procedures like:\nSplit skin graft harvesting and laser skin treatments\nVenipuncture and intravenous cannulation in childre\nLithotripsy\nCircumcisio\nEMLA is applied 45-60 minutes before the procedure with an occlusive dressing as shown in the image. It provides analgesia up to a depth of 5mm which lasts for 1-2 hours.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nTetracaine is the topical anesthesia of choice for the removal of foreign bodies from the cornea. Topical anesthetics used in ophthalmology include:\nTetracaine\nProparacaine eye drops\nLidocaine gel\nIntranasal cocaine\nSolution to Question 4:\nLidocaine has been the drug used most frequently for intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA).\nOther drugs used are:\nPrilocaine\nMepivacaine\nChloroprocaine\nProcaine\nEtidocaine\nIVRA or Bier\u2019s block involves the intravenous administration of a local anesthetic into a tourniquet-occluded limb.\nIt is used to provide anesthesia for short surgical procedures (&lt;90 minutes) on the limbs. The image below shows Bier's block/ IVRA.\n\nNote: Bupivacaine is not used for Biers block. It is the most cardiotoxic local anesthetic. Accidental early deflation of the tourniquet can lead to massive systemic doses of bupivacaine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe image shows a ganglion cyst planned for excision under Bier's block. Bupivacaine is no longer used for Biers block.\nBupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic local anaesthetic (LA). Accidental early deflation of the tourniquet can lead to massive systemic doses of bupivacaine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and\ncardiovascular collapse.\nIVRA or Bier\u2019s block involves the intravenous administration of LA into a tourniquet-occluded limb for short surgical procedures (&lt;45-60 minutes) on the limbs. Drugs used are\nlidocaine (most common), prilocaine, mepivacaine, chloroprocaine, procaine, and etidocaine.\nThe image below shows Bier's block of the upper limb. A double pneumatic tourniquet is inflated to 50-100mmHg above systolic BP after exsanguination of the limb with Esmarch bandage.",

    "question_text": "5-0.75%\nDense\nModerate to de nse\nSurgical anesthesia\nSolution to Question 11:\nRopivacaine is less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine is S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine. The R(+) isomer of bupivacaine is responsible\nfor cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic and has a higher safety profile than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine has a shorter duration of action and produces less motor block than bupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine. Epidural ropivacaine is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both spinal and epidural).\nNote: Levobupivacaine is another S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, with less cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine differs from levobupivacaine in the substitution of a propyl for the butyl group on the piperidine ring.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe CC/CNS ratio for bupivacaine is approximately 3 whereas, for lidocaine, it is 7.\nCardiotoxicity of local anaesthetics can be compared using the CC/CNS dose ratio, that is the ratio of the dose causing cardiac collapse (CC) to the dose causing seizure/convulsions (CNS).\nThe lower the number, the more cardiotoxic the drug. Therefore, progression from CNS signs and symptoms to cardiovascular collapse can occur more readily with bupivacaine than with lidocaine.\nNote: Patients under general anaesthesia will typically present with cardiotoxicity as the first sign of local anaesthetic toxicity.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe scenario describes methemoglobinemia, a side effect of prilocaine.\nPrilocaine is metabolized to O-toluidine, which converts hemoglobin (Fe2+) to methemoglobin\n(Fe3+) producing methemoglobinemia. This side effect is dose-dependent.\nTreatment of methemoglobinemia includes reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin by intravenous methylene blue (1\u20132 mg/kg of a 1% solution over 5 min).\nNote: Benzocaine used in topical local anesthetic sprays can also cause dangerous methemoglobinemia.\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe clinical scenario depicts the development of an allergic reaction to a local anesthetic agent. Allergic reactions are common with the use of procaine, an aminoester compound.\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe patient is on treatment with cotrimoxazole, a sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole). The action of sulfonamides is inhibited by procaine, and so it would not be preferred in this patient.\nProcaine is hydrolyzed in vivo to produce para-aminobenzoic (PABA) acid that inhibits the action of sulfonamides. All ester local anesthetics produce para-aminobenzoic acid.\nPrilocaine, lidocaine, and bupivacaine are amides and do not interact with sulphonamides.\nSolution to Question 16:\nAll are vasodilators except cocaine. Cocaine is a vasoconstrictor due to its property of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.\nOther local anaesthetics do not have the property of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe symptoms and the white powdery substance suggest the drug being abused by the man is cocaine. It produces mydriasis, not miosis.\nThe tactile hallucinations are a type of psychosis in cocaine addicts, known as Magnan syndrome.\nCocaine is an intrinsic vasoconstrictor with local anesthetic properties. Hence it is an ideal agent for awake nasal intubation as it reduces pain and epistaxis. It is metabolized by liver cholinesterases and excreted in urine\nIt has the potential for abuse as it produces euphoria by inhibiting the re-uptake of catecholamines (especially dopamine) in the CNS. Because of its abuse liability and high toxicity, cocaine use is limited to topical anesthesia of the upper respiratory tract.\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nProcaine is an aminoester.\nPrilocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine are amino amides.\nSolution to Question 19:\nLidocaine is an amino amide compound that is metabolized by microsomal P-450 enzymes in the liver.\nProcaine and tetracaine are amino esters that are metabolized by plasma esterases. Articaine is the only amino amide that is metabolized by the plasma esterases.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe least potent local anesthetic is procaine.\nThe potency of local anesthetics correlates with their hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic molecules are more potent and also longer acting.\nSolution to Question 21:\nMaximum absorption of local anesthetics takes place with intercostal nerve block. The degree and rate of absorption depend on the vascularity of the area the local anesthetic is exposed to.\nSolution to Question 22:\nBupivacaine is not used for intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) or Bier\u2019s block.\nBupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic of all local anesthetics. Accidental early deflation of the tourniquet in local anesthesia can lead to systemic toxicity.\nLidocaine is used for IVRA- 3mg/kg of 0.5% preservative-free lidocaine without epinephrine (25 mL for a forearm, 50 mL for an arm, and 100 mL for a thigh tourniquet).\nSolution to Question 23:\nRopivacaine is S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, not R(+).\nOption B: The R(+) isomer of bupivacaine is responsible for cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic and has a higher safety profile than bupivacaine.\nOption C: Ropivacaine has a shorter duration of action and produces less motor block than bupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine. Epidural ropivacaine is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine.\nOption D: Ropivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both spinal and epidural).\nNote: Levobupivacaine is another S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, with less cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine differs from levobupivacaine in the substitution of a propyl for the butyl group on the piperidine ring.\nSolution to Question 24:\nO-toluidine is a metabolic by-product of prilocaine. Metabolism of the aromatic ring of prilocaine to O-toluidine produces methemoglobinemia in a dose-dependent fashion.\nRegional Anesthesia: Techniques\nQuestion 1:\nIn adults, at which vertebral level does the spinal cord end?\nUpper border of L1\nLower border of L1\nUpper border of L3\nLower border of L3\nQuestion 2:\nYou are about to administer spinal anaesthesia to a 7-month-old child.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nIn adults, the spinal cord ends at the level of lower border of L1 vertebra.\nProximally, the spinal cord is continuous with the brain stem. Distally, it terminates in the conus medullaris as the filum terminale (fibrous extension) and the cauda equina (neural extension).\nThe lumbar puncture during spinal anesthesia (a.k.a. sub-arachnoid block, intra-thecal block) is done below the level of L1 in adults (L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 interspace), to avoid potential needle trauma to the spinal cord.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe spinal cord in infants ends at the upper border of L3 vertebral level (shorter vertebral column and longer spinal cord).\nLumbar (subarachnoid) puncture into the subarachnoid space is done below L3 in children to avoids potential needle trauma to the cord.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe dural sac in adults ends at S2 vertebral level.\nSo the spinal subdural and subarachnoid spaces extend from the foramen magnum to S2 in adults.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe needle should be kept below the S2 vertebral level as the subarachnoid space in children extends from the foramen magnum to S2-S3.\nBecause of this fact, and the smaller body size, caudal anesthesia carries a greater risk of subarachnoid injection in children than in adults.\nSolution to Question 5:\nTuffier's (intercristal) line is a line drawn between the highest points of both iliac crests usually crossing either the body of L4 or the L4\u2013L5 interspace.\nThis is the landmark to identify the spinal level prior to performing a neuraxial block. Other bony landmarks:\nC7 - Vertebra prominence\nT7 - Inferior angle of scapula L1 - Lower rib margin\nS2 - Posterior superior iliac spine\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe first sensation to disappear following a neuraxial block is cold.\nPre-ganglionic sympathetic fibers (B fibers) are most sensitive to local anesthetic blockade. The larger A-alpha motor fibers are more resistant than any of the sensory fibers.\nThe sensations lost at the earliest will be cold \uf0ae pinprick \uf0ae touch\nRegression of blockade (\u201crecovery\u201d) follows in the reverse order: motor function &gt; touch &gt;\npinprick &gt; cold sensation &gt; autonomic.\nControversial: There is an obvious discrepancy among various authors regarding the order of differential blockade. Some studies mention pin prick sensation to be lost before sensation to cold.\nBut our reference to this MCQ is from standard textbook of anesthesia (Miller's Anesthesia 9th edition).\nSolution to Question 7:\nMotor function recovers the earliest after a neuraxial block.\nMotor function is carried by A alpha fibers, which are myelinated and having the largest diameter, making them resistant to local anaesthesia.\nHence, motor function is the last to get affected and the first to recover.\nSolution to Question 8:\nAntiseptic of choice for neuraxial block procedure is Chlorhexidine.\nSolution to Question 9:\nDuring spinal anaesthesia administration, the posterior longitudinal ligament is not pierced. The following structures are pierced during spinal anaesthesia, in that order:\nSkin\nSubcutaneous tissue\nSupraspinous ligament\nInterspinous ligament\nLigamentum flavum\nDura mater\nArachnoid\nSolution to Question 10:\nSpinal anesthesia (subarachnoid block, intrathecal block) involves the administration of local anesthetic between the pia and arachnoid mater.\nIn spinal anesthesia, the local anesthetic is injected into CSF, which bathes the nerve root.\nHence, a relatively small dose and volume of local anesthetic is sufficient to achieve dense sensory and motor blockade.\nEpidural anesthesia involves local anesthetic administration between the dura and ligamentum flavum. Subdural injection, seen in a failed spinal anesthesia, is between dura and arachnoid.\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nIn a normal-sized adult, the patient's height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anaesthesia. However, at extremes of height, consideration should be given to altering the dose accordingly.\nOption A: Advanced age is associated with increased block height, due to decreased CSF volume Option B: CSF volume is inversely related to the block level.\nOption D: Patient's position affects the spread of hyperbaric and hypobaric solutions. Hyperbaric solution settles at the dependent position while hypobaric solution settles at the non-dependent position.\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, among the options given.\nTheoretically, the density of CSF is lower in women than in men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anaesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimportant. Hence, this is the best answer to choose from the above options.\nOption A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anaesthetic.\nOption C: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors.\nOption D: Within the range of \u201cnormal-sized\u201d adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anaesthesia. But, extremes of height can affect the block height.\nSolution to Question 13:\nFor a cesarean section, the sensory block should be achieved up to T4 dermatomal level (motor T\u2020), as the pain-sensitive peritoneum innervation starts from T4 level.\nThe risk of high spinal and severe hypotension is higher because the block has to reach T4. Hence, consider prehydration with 20 ml/kg, proper positioning, and keeping phenylephrine or ephedrine on hand.\nDermatomal Level required for Various Common Surgical Procedures:\nT4 - Upper abdominal surgery\nT10 - Transurethral resection of prostate\nT10 - Hip surgery\nL2 - Foot and ankle surgery\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe instrument shown is the Quincke Needle used in spinal anesthesia. The Quincke needle is a cutting needle with end injection.\nSpinal needles are long thin needles that are classified based on their tip into:\nCutting needles: Quincke-Babcock, Pitkin\nPencil tip needles: Whitacre and Sprotte\n\n\nThis is the image of a Tuohy needle that is used to provide epidural anesthesia. It can be recognised by its curved (Huber) tip and the markings made at 1 cm interval along it's length.\n\nThe above image shows a Combined Spinal Epidural needle. It consists of a spinal needle passed through the epidural needle.\nSolution to Question 15:\nAll of the above are blunt-tipped needles used in regional anesthesia, except Quincke, which is a cutting type of spinal needle.\nTypes of spinal needles:\nCutting needle\nNon-cutting (Splitting, pencil point, blunt) needle\nCut the dura\nSplit the dura\nHence, higher incidence of p ostdural puncture headache ( PDPH) due to CSF leak\nHence, lower incidence of PD PH\nTechnically less challenging a s loss of resistance is well ap preciated during lumbar pun cture\nTechnically more challenging as loss of resistance is not\nell appreciated\nEg: Quincke-Babcock, Pitkin\nEg: Whitacre, Sprotte\n\nTips of various spinal needles\nTuohy needle is the most commonly used needle for epidural anaesthesia. It has a blunt\n'Huber' tip, which helps to prevent accidental penetration of the dura.\n\nImage: Touhy epidural needle with Huber tip\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe image shown is the 18 G Tuohy needle, which is used in epidural anesthesia. Identification points:\nIt has a blunt, curved tip (Huber tip) that helps to prevent accidental dural puncture\nThe needle shaft is marked in 1-cm intervals so that the depth of insertion can be identified\n\nEpidural anesthesia set with Touhy's needle and epidural catheter.\nOther epidural needles: Crawford needle (straight needles without a curved tip): has a greater incidence of dural puncture.\nSolution to Question 17:\nDuring epidural anesthesia, the local anesthetic is injected into the epidural/extradural space. This is marked in the image as B.\nThe epidural space exists between the dura and the ligamentum flavum posteriorly. The other markings are as follows:\nA: Subarachnoid space",

      "Subcutaneous tissue Solution to Question 18: Dura mater is not pierced while performing an epidural block. The structures pierced during epidural anesthesia: Skin Subcutaneous tissue Supraspinous ligament Interspinous ligament Ligamentum flavum Epidural space is a potential negative pressure space. This factor is exploited in the identification of epidural space. As the needle penetrates the ligamentum flavum, an increase in resistance is encountered. After which when the needle enters the epidural space, a sudden loss of resistance is encountered. The techniques to identify epidural space: Loss of resistance (to injection of air or saline) Hanging drop (drop of saline is sucked in as the needle enters epidural space) Solution to Question 19: To prevent hemodynamic disturbances, we must prevent the migration of the spinal block to upper thoracic segments. In the sitting position, this can be achieved by using a hyperbaric solution like bupivacaine with glucose. Baricity of local anesthetics refers to the specific gravity of the solution with respect to that of CSF. A hyperbaric solution (addition of glucose) of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, a hypobaric solution (addition of sterile water or fentanyl) is lighter than CSF and isobaric solution (plain or 1:1 CSF) has density same as that of CSF. Hyperbaric solution tends to move to the dependent area of the spine. While a hypobaric solution moves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric solution moves caudally. In clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia. A hypobaric solution is only used in prone jackknife position to specifically block the operative site around perineum during certain anorectal surgeries. Solution to Question 20: Electromyography, Modified Bromage scale, and spirometry can all be used to test the adequacy of the motor block after neuraxial anesthesia. The Modified Bromage Scale is most commonly used, but the disadvantage is that this represents only lumbosacral motor fibers. Modified Bromage scale 0: No motor block"

The sacrococcygeal ligament covers the sacral hiatus that is created by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae.\nSacral hiatus is well appreciated in children. Hence, it is a common regional technique in paediatrics for procedures below the diaphragm, including urogenital, rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgery.\nIt may also be used for anorectal surgery in adults but it is technically challenging in adults.\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe landmarks depicted in the image are in reference to caudal anaesthesia. It is a common regional technique in paediatrics for procedures below the diaphragm, including urogenital, rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgery.\nCaudal anaesthesia involves deposition of local anaesthetic in the caudal epidural space, accessed through the sacral hiatus. Sacral hiatus is formed by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae and is covered by the sacrococcygeal ligament.\nThe lines joining the posterior superior iliac spines and sacral hiatus make an equilateral triangle. The sacral hiatus is felt as a groove or notch above the coccyx and between two bony prominences, the sacral cornua.\nIt is better appreciated in children than in adults and hence it is a common regional technique among pediatric patients.\n\nRegional Anesthesia: Complications and Contraindications\nQuestion 1:\nA 65-year-old lady with a history of motion sickness underwent a knee replacement under spinal anesthesia.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nIntrathecal morphine has a higher risk and incidence of nausea and vomiting among opioids as compared to fentanyl/sufentanil.\nThis is because hydrophilic opioids (morphine) remain in CSF for a prolonged duration than lipophilic opioids (fentanyl) and sensitize the central chemoreceptor trigger zone.\nThe Apfel score is used to predict the risk of developing postoperative nausea and vomiting\n(PONV). According to this, risk factors are:\nPost-operative use of opioids\nNon-smoker\nFemale gender\nHistory of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or motion sickness\nAdditional risk factors are the use of nitrous oxide as an inhalational anesthetic agent and the duration of anesthesia.\nOndansetron with or without dexamethasone is used in the management of this condition. The use of propofol in balanced or total IV anesthesia (TIVA) significantly reduces the incidence of PONV.\nSolution to Question 2:\nPost-neuraxial shivering is more common with epidural than spinal anaesthesia.\nThe possible reasons include the use of a large volume of cold epidural injectate as compared to a small volume of spinal drug and the inability to shiver with spinal anaesthesia because of the profound motor block as compared with epidural techniques.\nPost-neuraxial shivering:\nThe incidence of post-neuraxial shivering is more than 40% (~55%)\nThe addition of neuraxial opioids (fentanyl, pethidine) reduces the likelihood of shivering\nPrewarming the patient with a forced-air warmer and avoiding the administration of cold epidural and intravenous fluids helps to prevent shivering\nIt has no relation to malignant hyperthermia\nIntravenous meperidine and tramadol are used in the treatment\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe most common cause of apnea following neuraxial blockade is hypotension leading to hypoperfusion of the brain stem respiratory centers.\nDiaphragmatic paralysis would require the height of the block up to the cervical level (phrenic nerve), which is very rare. However, it can occur in the setting of high spinal up to the cervical level and total spinal anesthesia.\nBlockade of the intercostal and abdominal muscles during neuraxial anesthesia is adequately compensated by an unaltered function of the diaphragm and other accessory respiratory muscles.\nSystemic toxicity of the local anesthetic would mainly affect the central nervous system and cardiovascular system.\nSolution to Question 4:\nSpinal-anesthesia-induced hypotension is treated with ephedrine (most commonly), mephentermine or phenylephrine. Epinephrine is reserved only for refractory hypotension or cardiac arrest following spinal anesthesia.\nRisk factors for spinal-anesthesia-induced hypotension:\nPeak block height greater than or equal to T5\nAge older than or equal to 40 years\nBaseline systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg\nCombined spinal and general anesthesia\nSpinal puncture at or above the L2-L3 interspace Clinical features:\nSBP &lt; 90 mmHg\nNausea precedes hypotension (first symptom to appear)\nApnea due to medullary hypoperfusion\nBradycardia Treatment:\nRapid administration of intravenous fluids\nHead-down position (only after local anesthesia is fixed (~20 minutes for bupivacaine), else, hyperbaric solution can ascend and lead to high spinal)\nIntravenous vasopressors (ephedrine, phenylephrine)\nBradycardia is treated with atropine\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe sympathetic cardio-accelerator fibers include T1\u2013T4.\nHigh spinal block above the level of T4, will block the cardio-acceleratory fibers which supply the heart. This would lead to severe bradycardia along with hypotension.\nSolution to Question 6:\nPost-dural puncture headache is most commonly seen with 22G Quincke needle (22G has a larger diameter than 25G). So it should be avoided in cases with a higher risk of PDPH.\nTypes of spinal needles:\nCutting needle\nNon-cutting (Splitting, pencil point, blunt) needle\nCut the dura\nSplit the dura\nHence higher incidence of po st dural puncture headache ( PDPH) due to CSF leak\nHence, lower incidence of PD PH\nTechnically less challenging a s loss of resistance is well ap preciated during lumbar pun cture\nTechnically more challenging as loss of resistance is not w ell appreciated\nEg: Quincke-Babcock, Pitkin\nEg: Whitacre, Sprotte\nSolution to Question 7:\nPost-dural puncture headache worsens with upright or sitting position and is relieved by supine position.\nPost-dural puncture headache is believed to result from puncture of the dura (unintentional or intentional) in the setting of neuraxial anaesthesia. This causes leakage of CSF from a dural defect eading to intracranial hypotension.\nThe characteristic feature of a post-dural puncture headache is the frontal or an occipital headache.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe timing of ambulation does not seem to affect the incidence of post-dural puncture headache, i.e., early ambulation does not increase the incidence.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe scenario given in the question is most likely post-dural puncture headache(PDPH). The definitive treatment for post-dural puncture headache is epidural blood patch. The remaining options are conservative management approaches for PDPH.\nProcedure:\nIdeally, performed 24 hours after dural puncture and development of classic PDPH symptoms.",

Approximately 90% of patients will respond to a single blood patch, and 90% of initial nonresponders will obtain relief from a second injection.\nSolution to Question 10:\nProphylactic blood patch is not recommended as its efficacy is not supported by evidence.

Hence, the anaesthetic injected into the subdural space can ascend to higher levels than epidural medications.\nAs with high spinal anaesthesia, treatment is supportive and may require intubation, mechanical ventilation, and cardiovascular support.\nOption B - Accidental subarachnoid injection manifests immediately with similar features. Option C - Accidental intravascular injection presents with CNS and CVS symptoms.\nOption D - Allergic manifestation presents with hives, angioedema and, bronchospasm.\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe above condition is most likely due to accidental intravascular injection of local anaesthetic into the epidural vein resulting in local anaesthesia systemic toxicity (LAST).\nFeatures of LAST:\nCNS (in the order of appearance)\nTinnitus, blurred vision, dizziness, tongue paresthesia, and circumoral numbness\nExcitatory signs such as nervousness, agitation, restlessness, and muscle twitching leading to tonic-clonic seizures\nCNS depression with slurred speech, drowsiness, unconsciousness, and then respiratory arrest\nPatients who have received CNS depressant drugs may present with only CNS depression without any preceding excitatory signs\nCVS\nProlonged PR intervals and widened QRS complexes, and sinus bradycardia/arrest\nVentricular arrhythmias, including fibrillation, are more likely to occur with bupivacaine than idocaine\nPrevention:\nCareful aspiration for CSF (to rule out intrathecal placement) and blood (to rule out intravascular placement) before injecting the local anaesthesia\nUse of a test dose with lidocaine and adrenaline\nIncremental injection techniques instead of a bolus dose\nClose observation for early signs of intravascular injection Treatment:\nSeizures: Benzodiazepine; if not available, a small dose of propofol or thiopentone. If seizures persist, a neuromuscular blockade to minimize acidosis and hypoxemia\nCardiac arrest: standard ACLS protocol with few modifications\nLipid emulsion therapy\nLast resort: cardio-pulmonary bypass\nSolution to Question 14:\nUsing bolus dose does not prevent systemic toxic side effects from accidental intravascular injection of local anaesthetics.\nThe major systemic toxic side effects from accidental intravascular injection can be avoided by\nInitial test dose\nAspirating prior to each injection (negative aspiration for blood)\nUsing incremental dosing\nClose observation for early signs of intravascular injection (tinnitus, lingual sensations)\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe above case scenario is suggestive of bacterial meningitis following epidural anaesthesia. The most common organism responsible for bacterial meningitis following neuraxial blockade (spinal\nand epidural) is Streptococcus viridians.\nHowever, the most common organisms responsible for epidural-anaesthesia-related local infection (abscess) is Staphylococcus.\nStreptococcus viridians is an oral commensal, emphasizing the purpose of wearing a mask as part of a full aseptic technique.\nSolution to Question 16:\nBeing on low dose aspirin is not a contraindication for the use of centrineuraxial anaesthesia. So, it is safe to administer it to a patient on low dose aspirin.\nThis is because use of most antiplatelet agents (eg. Aspirin &amp; NSAIDs) is not associated with an increased risk of complications from centrineuraxial anaesthesia.\nLMWH administration must be stopped prophylactically (12 hours prior) and therapeutically (24 hours prior) to centrineuraxial anaesthesia. It can be done only after checking if the platelet count is normal (if LMWH has been administered for more than 4 days). This is due to reports of spinal/epidural hematomas when centrineuraxial anaesthesia is given to patients on LMWH.\nSolution to Question 17:\nAll of the above are absolute contraindications for spinal anaesthesia except myelopathy, which is a relative contraindication.\nIn the setting of neurological deficit (myelopathy), careful evaluation of neurologic status must first be undertaken and noted along with documentation of the discussion of the risks and benefits for a medico-legal purpose.\nSolution to Question 18:\nPatient being on antihypertensives like CCBs (amlodipine) is not a contraindication for a neuraxia block.\nPatient on antiplatelets:\nAntiplatelets (except aspirin and NSAIDs) should be withheld till their effects have worn off as they increase the risk of spinal hematoma.\nAntiplatelet s\nWaiting peri od\nClopidogrel",

Postoperative LMWH thromboprophylaxis:\nRemove epidural catheter 2 hours prior to the first LMWH dose\nIf thromboprophylaxis is already started, remove epidural catheter 10 hours after a dose of LMWH. Subsequent LMWH dosing is given 2 hours after the removal of the catheter.\nSolution to Question 20:\nAn interval of atleast 4 hours must be there between her last dose of unfractionated heparin and the surgical procedure being performed under neuraxial block.\nAs the patient has CKD, only unfractionated heparin can be used in her.

    "question_text": "\nb\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe above image shows the surface marking used to perform interscalene block. The local anaesthetic is injected into the interscalene groove present behind the sternocleidomastoid at the level of cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebral level).\nThis is a brachial plexus block performed at the trunk level.\nLevel\nType of block\nSuperior & middle trunk (infe rior trunk blockade is incom plete)\nInterscalene\nDistal trunk & proximal divis ion\nSupraclavicul ar\nCords\nInfraclavicula\nTerminal nerves\nAxillary\n\nIt provides an adequate block of the superior and middle trunks of the brachial plexus. So, interscalene block provides surgical anesthesia for procedures of the shoulder and upper arm.\nUlnar nerve (C8, T1) from inferior trunk may be missed. Hence, this block is not used for procedures of the forearm and hand.\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe most common complication of interscalene block, seen in 100% of patients, is diaphragmatic hemiparesis due to ipsilateral phrenic nerve blockade.\nThis can result in dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypercapnea, especially if the patient has compromised lung function or preexisting contralateral phrenic nerve paralysis.\nOther complications of interscalene block are:\nHorner's syndrome \u2013 ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis. Due to involvement of the sympathetic nerves to the cervicothoracic ganglion.\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve palsy\nVagus nerve involvement\nPneumothorax\nBezold Jarisch reflex\nAccidental vertebral artery injection (immediate seizure is seen)\nAccidental spinal or epidural injection\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe regional anesthetic technique preferred for surgery of dislocated shoulder is interscalene brachial plexus block.\nBrachial plexus bloc k\nLevel\nIndication\nLimitation\nInterscalene\nSuperior and middle trunk\nShoulder and upper a rm\nUlnar nerve sparing\nSupraclavicular\nDistal trunk and proximal di vision\nElbow, forearm and ha nd\nAxillary and suprascapular n erve sparing, pneumothorax, phrenic nerve palsy\nInfraclavicular\nCords\nForearm and hand\nIntercostobrachial nerve spar ing\nAxillary\nTerminal nerves\nForearm and hand\nMusculocutaneous, axillary, medial cutaneous nerve bran ches sparing;Inadvertent int avascular injection\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe procedure being performed is the supraclavicular block. It can be identified by the point of injection 2 cm posterior to the mid-point of clavicle.\nThe block is given at the level distal to trunks and proximal to divisions of the brachial plexus. It is also known as the 'spinal of the arm'.\n\nIt is a type of brachial plexus block used for procedures on the elbow, forearm, and hand. The supraclavicular block does not adequately block the axillary and suprascapular nerves, and thus is not reliable for shoulder surgery.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe most common complication of supraclavicular block is phrenic nerve palsy with an incidence\n&gt; 50 %.\nThis results in hemidiaphragmatic paresis which is self-limited and resolves as the block wears off.\nComplications &amp; side-effects of supraclavicular block :\nHemidiaphragmatic paresis - due to phrenic nerve palsy\nPneumothorax - highest when compared to other brachial plexus blocks\nHorners syndrome - from a block of the stellate ganglion\nHoarseness - due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and/or cervical sympathetic block Note :\nPneumothorax is the most dangerous complication of the supraclavicular block but it is not the most common. It has an incidence that ranges from 0.5- 6%. The symptoms develop slowly, and may take up to 24 hours.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe incidence of pneumothorax is maximum with supraclavicular block (0.5- 6%) among all the approaches to brachial plexus block.\nThe risk can be minimised by performing ultrasound guided block.\nSolution to Question 7:\nSupraclavicular block is not reliable for shoulder surgeries as axillary and suprascapular nerves are spared. So it will not be of much use in a case of posterior shoulder dislocation.\nSupraclavicular block is a type of brachial plexus block used for procedures on the elbow, forearm, and hand. It provides an adequate block of the brachial plexus at the level of the distal trunk - proximal division.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe image shows the surface marking for performing infraclavicular block. This block is performed at a point 2 cm medial and 2 cm caudal to the coracoid process which is used as a landmark.\nThe brachial plexus is blocked at the level of cords.\n\nThe Infraclavicular block is used for procedures of the forearm and hand.\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe image shows a local anesthetic being injected into the tip of the axilla around the axillary artery. This is the method used to perform the axillary block. It reliably produces anesthesia of the entire arm distal to the elbow, and so can be used for all of the given procedures, except fixation of the shaft of the humerus.\n\nThe terminal branches of the brachial plexus can be blocked via the axillary approach.\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe axillary block is the most preferred approach to the brachial plexus in pediatric patients for surgeries of the elbow, forearm, and hand.\nIt is a relatively easy and safe procedure. Complications include systemic toxicity due to accidental intraarterial injection and permanent nerve injury from the intraneural injection.\nSolution to Question 11:\nPudendal nerve block involves S2S3S4.\nSolution to Question 12:\nMost common complication of celiac plexus block is postural hypotension. Celiac plexus:\nLargest plexus of the sympathetic nervous system.\nContains preganglionic sympathetic from greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves (T5 to T12), postganglionic sympathetic, preganglionic parasympathetic and visceral sensory afferent fibres.\nProvides sensory innervation and sympathetic outflow to stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney and GI tract up to splenic flexure.\nLocated in the retroperitoneal space, anterior to aorta at the level of L1.\nIndication: Pain arising from the abdominal viscera, particularly intra-abdominal cancers (Eg.\npancreatic cancer). Complications:\nOrthostatic hypotension (most common, can be minimized with fluid hydration)\nDiarrhea (secondary to blockade of sympathetic fibers)\nParaplegia (from damage to artery of Adamkiewicz)\nLocal anesthetic toxicity, spinal or epidural injection, retroperitoeneal hemorrhage, visceral organ injury, and pneumothorax.\nAnaesthetic Implication of Concurrent Diseases\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following agents is to be avoided in a hypertensive patient?\nThiopentone\nPropofo\nKetamine\nEtomidate\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following muscle relaxants should be avoided in a hypertensive patient?\nPancuronium\nRocuronium\nVecuronium\nAtracurium\nQuestion 3:\nA 4-year-old child is observed to have difficulty in breathing along with bluish discolouration of his lips and fingers while playing.

Which of the following agents is most likely responsible for this condition?\nOxygen\nNitrous oxide\nDesflurane\nSevoflurane\nQuestion 8:\nAn awake craniotomy is being performed on a patient when there is a sudden drop in his blood pressure. The surgeon is suspecting a complication of venous air embolism (VAE). Which of the following is true about the condition?\nAll VAE can be detected clinically by a decrease in end tidal carbon dioxide\nA decrease in oxygen saturation will not always be seen, even with larger emboli\nPatients with left to right shunt, are susceptible to paradoxical air embolism\nThe surgeon has no role in the management of VAE\nQuestion 9:\nA 40-year-old male in kidney failure with a serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dl is scheduled for surgery.

This is due to central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. And hence it should be cautiously used in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.\nIts stimulatory effects may be beneficial to patients with acute shock. All other intravenous induction agents like propofol, thiopentone and etomidate produce a fall in blood pressure.\nSolution to Question 2:\nPancuronium is avoided in hypertensive patients because it causes vagal blockade and sympathetic stimulation which can aggravate hypertension.\nFor the same reason, it is to be cautiously used in patients with-\nCoronary artery disease\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nAortic stenosis.\nSolution to Question 3:\nKetamine is the induction agent of choice in this patient who is likely suffering from tetralogy of Fallot because it maintains or increases systemic vascular resistance and increases cardiac output.\nTetralogy of Fallot is characterized by sub pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect and overriding of the aorta. This results in a right to left shunt through\nthe ventricular septal defect and consequent cyanosis.\nThe commonest symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and exercise intolerance and develop blue skin (cyanosis) when agitated and are known as tet spells. The patients assume a sitting posture (squatting) or knee-chest position as soon as they get dyspneic, which leads to temporary symptomatic relief.\nKetamine does not aggravate the right to left shunt seen in such cases. It also does not increase pulmonary vascular resistance in children as compared to adults and is hence safe to administer in children.\nKetamine is the agent of choice in all cyanotic congenital heart diseases.\nSolution to Question 4:\nWide fixed split S2 is suggestive of atrial septal defect (ASD) and sevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for induction in a child undergoing cardiac surgery.\nHalothane and sevoflurane are non-pungent and hence can be used for induction in pediatric patients. Sevoflurane is not associated with significant myocardial depression as is seen with halothane. Hence, sevoflurane is preferred over halothane especially in all cardiovascular surgeries in the paediatric age group.\nFollowing induction, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most commonly used inhalation agents for maintenance.\nSolution to Question 5:\nGeneral anaesthesia is preferred in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\nSpinal and epidural anaesthesia are relatively contraindicated. This is because regional anaesthesia produces profound hypotension which can lead to a fall in preload, afterload or both.\nMost general anaesthetics especially the volatile agents also cause vasodilation and hypotension which can be treated with escalating doses of vasopressors like phenylephrine.\nMild to moderate aortic stenosis are not contraindications to regional anaesthesia. In such situations, epidural anaesthesia is preferred over spinal because of its slower onset of hypotension which can be adequately corrected.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe anti-hypertensive that is discontinued 24hours before surgery is ACE inhibitor due to the risk of hemodynamic instability.\nAlthough the continuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is controversial, among the given options this is the best answer. If these drugs are continued, vasopressin is the drug of choice for refractory hypotension.\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given case scenario is suggestive of pneumocephalus and nitrous oxide is responsible for causing this condition.\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe correct statement regarding venous air embolism (VAE) is, a decrease in oxygen saturation will not always be seen, even with larger emboli.\nVAE can occur when the pressure within an open vein is subatmospheric. It can occur in any position or procedure, whenever the wound is above the level of the heart. The incidence of venous air embolism is greater during sitting craniotomies than in craniotomies in any other position.\nOption A: Physiological monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide) have poor sensitivity and specificity and the clinical signs are manifested\nlate. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive method to monitor and can detect up to 0.02ml/kg of air embolism.\nOption C: Patients with a right to left shunt are susceptible to paradoxical air emboli which can result in a stroke or coronary occlusion.\nOption D: The surgeon should be notified immediately so that he or she can flood the surgical field with saline or pack it with wet gauzes and apply bone wax to the skull edges until the entry site is identified and occluded.\nSolution to Question 9:\nSuccinylcholine, atracurium and cis-atracurium can be used in this patient who has a renal failure with elevated serum creatinine(normal value- 0.8\u20131.3 mg/dL in men and 0.6\u20131 mg/dL in women).\nSuccinylcholine can be safely administered to patients with diminished or absent kidney function provided serum potassium levels are normal. If the serum potassium is increased, then a\nnon-depolarizing muscle relaxant like atracurium or cisatracurium which is non-dependent on renal excretion is to be used. Atracurium or cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination which is non-enzymatic spontaneous degradation.\nPancuronium is almost entirely dependent on the kidney for excretion (60\u201390%). Pancuronium has a prolonged elimination half-life in renal failure patients and thus should be used very cautiously.",

    "question_text": "60% of d-tubocurarine is excreted via the kidney and so prolonged effects are seen with rena insufficiency\nSolution to Question 10:\nSpinal anaesthesia is the preferred choice of anaesthetic for the TURP procedure.\nRegional anaesthesia is preferred over general anaesthesia in TURP due to the following reasons:\nLess likely to mask the symptoms of TURP syndrome\nHelps assess patients mental status as an alteration in mental status is an early sign of TURP\nA lesser amount of operative blood loss and lesser risk of DVT.\nLess likely to mask symptoms of bladder perforation like nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, shoulder pain, and hiccups.\nDecreased need for analgesics in the immediate post-operative period. Spinal anaesthesia is preferred over epidural anaesthesia due to:\nEasier to perform in elderly patients.\nDuration of surgery is not usually long, so an epidural is not required.\nEpidural anaesthesia may incompletely block the sacral nerve roots which can be avoided with spinal anaesthesia.\nCaudal anaesthesia may be used in high-risk patients undergoing laser prostatectomy as it provides the advantage of hemodynamic stability. Local infiltration does not provide sufficient operative analgesia as spinal anaesthesia.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe neuromuscular blocker (NMB) of choice in a cirrhotic patient is cisatracurium. It is used as NMB of choice because of its nonhepatic metabolism.\nSolution to Question 12:\nSevoflurane is the inhalational anaesthetic agent of choice during liver transplantation because it is superior to other inhalational agents in preserving hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic oxygen delivery.\nThe liver has an autoregulatory mechanism called the hepatic arterial buffer response(HABF)- when portal blood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial blood flow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow. This response is preserved in sevoflurane.\nSolution to Question 13:\nSpinal anaesthesia is preferred in elderly patients undergoing major vascular and orthopaedic surgeries.\nThey are preferred over general anaesthesia due to:\nDecreased incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism\nLocal anaesthetics used will inhibit platelet aggregation and stabilize endothelial cells\nRegional anaesthesia is associated with less surgical blood loss\nLower incidence of hypoxemia as it avoids airway instrumentation\nBut the disadvantage with regional anaesthesia is that due to hypotension, patients with coronary artery disease will have increased oxygen demand due to reflex tachycardia and reduced coronary perfusion.\nSolution to Question 14:\nRemifentanil is the opioid that was most likely used in this elderly patient.\nRemifentanil is hydrolysed by plasma and tissue esterases and so its metabolism is independent of hepatic and renal function- no dose adjustment is required and is safe in liver failure patients and renal failure patients.\nBecause of this hydrolysis, it has a high clearance and is eliminated rapidly with a quick recovery (\nhalf-life less than 10 minutes) and thus is preferred in elderly patients.\nSolution to Question 15:\nKetamine is the ideal agent of choice to provide sedation and analgesia in the prehospital setting.\nDrugs that can be used by nurses and paramedics in the prehospital setting like the site of RTA/Trauma should have-\nWide safety margin, even for inexperienced providers\nHemodynamic stability\nMinimal respiratory depression\nEase of administration\nEarly-onset of action\nKetamine provides potent analgesia and sedation for entrapped patients with trauma during extrication. It maintains hemodynamic stability in patients with hypovolemic shock, is a potent bronchodilator, and causes minimal respiratory depression. Because of its hallucinogenic properties, benzodiazepines should be co-administered. In larger doses, it can be used for induction of anaesthesia.\nOption C: Benzodiazepines like diazepam and midazolam have wide safety margins and can be administered via many routes and can be used to provide sedation, but lack an analgesic action.\nOption A and B: Propofol causes hemodynamic instability and respiratory depression and thiopentone produces effects similar to propofol.\nSolution to Question 16:\nPropofol is not an ideal agent for induction in a patient with haemorrhagic shock.\nPropofol when given to a patient in hemorrhagic shock will lead to worsening of shock due to the profound hypotensive action because of its vasodilatory and negative inotropic effects.\nOption B: Etomidate preserves the sympathetic tone and has cardiovascular stability. Thus it is safer to use than propofol.\nOption C: Ketamine has been effectively used in trauma patients because it is a CNS stimulant. It has indirect cardiovascular effects due to central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine which is beneficial in acute shock.\nSolution to Question 17:\nEpidural anaesthesia is used to provide adequate analgesia which is the mainstay of treatment in patients with multiple rib fractures.\nThe complications can be minimized by adequate pain relief with epidural anaesthesia. Rib fracture patients will have the following complications due to splinting and pain:\nHypoventilation\nHypoxia\nOther techniques to provide analgesia following rib fractures are intercostal nerve block and intrapleural block which necessitates multiple injections, which increases the risk for complications.\nThe complications include vascular puncture, pneumothorax, patient discomfort due to the need for palpation of the fractured rib during local anaesthetic (LA) administration. Also, LA toxicity can occur because of the high systemic absorption.\nOption A: General Anaesthesia is more invasive to manage patient with multiple rib fractures and has potentially more side effects and complications than Epidural Anaesthesia. Endotracheal intubation as treatment is reserved only for patients who cannot maintain an airway or maintain sufficient oxygen saturation.\nOption B: Spinal anaesthesia involves a high level of anaesthesia which is required to cover the thoracic dermatomes which would lead to high spinal or total spinal anaesthesia.\nOption D: Infraclavicular block is a brachial plexus block that is used for the upper limbs.\nSolution to Question 18:\nGeneral anaesthesia is preferred in this patient because of the insufficient block and patient discomfort associated with local anaesthesia.\nLocal anaesthesia may be suitable for simple procedures such as-\nCauterization\nPolypectomy\nTurbinectomy\nGeneral anaesthesia may be used for the following procedures-\nOpen nasal fracture reduction\nSeptoplasty\nRhinoplasty\nNote- Closed nasal fracture reduction is performed with propofol sedation as the procedure is extremely painful.\nSolution to Question 19:\nNitrous oxide is avoided in laser surgeries as it supports combustion.\nOxygen concentration should be limited to the lowest, so as to maintain acceptable saturation levels to prevent the possibility of fire while using lasers.\nSolution to Question 20:\nPropofol is preferred for induction in patients undergoing stapedectomy or any ear surgery, especially the inner ear.\nSurgeries that can be conducted with propofol as induction agent-\nStapedectomy or stapedotomy\nTympanoplasty\nMastoidectomy\nMyringotomy with insertion of tympanostomy tubes\nSolution to Question 21:\nNitrous oxide is avoided in middle ear surgeries.\nThis is because nitrous oxide can increase middle ear pressure as it can diffuse into air-containing cavities because it is more soluble in blood than nitrogen.\nIf nitrous oxide had been used in an overlay procedure, it would lead to pressure build-up inside the middle ear and displacement of the graft.\nSolution to Question 22:\nMuscle relaxants are avoided during a procedure of parotidectomy.\nThe most common surgery for pleomorphic adenoma is superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection. It is essential to preserve the facial nerve and hence, nerve stimulators are used during the surgery to identify the facial nerve and its branches. This cannot be possible if muscle relaxation is present.\nSolution to Question 23:\nOxymetazoline is the preferred topical vasoconstrictor in ENT surgeries due to the safety profile and easy availability of the drug.",

    "question_text": "05% solution is administered as 3 nasal sprays in each nostril before any nasal procedure. It should be avoided in patients who are on monoamine oxidase inhibitors as the interaction can result in high blood pressure.\nOption B: Phenylephrine is an \uf0b0 -adrenergic agonist topical vasoconstrictor. It can cause severe hypertension and blood pressure monitoring is required.\nOption C: Cocaine has cardiovascular effects- it is sympathomimetic and when administered at a concentration of 4%, it inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine at sympathetic nerve terminals thus making it unsafe in patients with coronary artery disease or those on monoamine oxidase inhibitors.\nOption A: Lidocaine as such does not have vasoconstrictor properties but may be used with phenylephrine.\nSolution to Question 24:\nPhenylephrine cannot be used to achieve controlled hypotension during nasopharyngeal carcinoma surgeries.\nPhenylephrine is a selective \uf0b0 \u25a0-adrenergic receptor agonist of the phenethylamine class and can cause an increase in blood pressure. Hence it cannot be used to achieve hypotensive anaesthesia in any procedures.\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe medial rectus muscle is the most likely muscle to elicit bradycardia (oculocardiac reflex) when stimulated.\nTraction on the extraocular muscles or pressure on the globe causes bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, or asystole and is known as oculocardiac reflex. In particular, it is seen with traction on the medial rectus muscle, but it can occur with stimulation of any of the orbital contents, including the periosteum.\nSolution to Question 26:\nStimulation of any of the orbital contents can cause oculocardiac reflex.\nTraction on the extraocular muscles or pressure on the globe causes bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, or asystole and is known as oculocardiac reflex. In particular, it is seen with traction on the medial rectus muscle, but it can occur with stimulation of any of the orbital contents, including the periosteum.\nSolution to Question 27:\nThe most common complication seen in the procedure of retrobulbar block is retrobulbar haemorrhage.\nThe image shown above depicts the technique of retrobulbar block which is a regional anaesthesia technique used in ophthalmic surgery. It involves the injection of a local anaesthetic into the extraocular muscle cone. The needle penetrates the lower lid at the junction of the middle and lateral one-third of the orbit.\nSolution to Question 28:\nRetrobulbar blocks are not contraindicated in enucleation of the eyes.\nThe Retrobulbar block is a regional anesthesia technique used in ophthalmic surgical procedures which involves the injection of a local anesthetic into the extraocular muscle cone.\nSolution to Question 29:\nGeneral anaesthesia is the ideal anaesthetic technique to be used in a person who has to undergo surgery for a penetrating eye injury.\nRegional anaesthesia is relatively contraindicated in patients with penetrating eye injuries because injecting local anaesthetic behind the globe increases intraocular pressure and may lead to the expulsion of intraocular contents.\nTherefore these patients require general anaesthesia\u2014despite the increased risk of aspiration pneumonia when it is administered.\nSolution to Question 30:\nKetamine should be avoided in a child presenting with open globe injury as it can increase intraocular pressure.\nIt usually raises arterial blood pressure and also does not relax extraocular muscles and may cause nystagmus and blepharospasm.\nSolution to Question 31:\nContinuous epidural anesthesia is the first choice for most patients with preeclampsia during labor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section.\nPre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thus continuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides, continuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decrease catecholamine secretion.\nBut one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal platelet count and normal coagulation. Coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia.\nMinimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 100,000/\uf06dL, but some cases can be taken up with a platelet count as low as 70,000/\uf06dL.\nGeneral anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with complications.\nSpinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia.\nSince the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned, epidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hence the best option here would be epidural anesthesia.\nSolution to Question 32:\nIn DCR, the ratio of PRBC: fresh frozen plasma: platelets is 1:1:1.\nAdministering blood products in the appropriate ratios in order to facilitate resuscitation from trauma and avert trauma-induced coagulopathy is termed damage control resuscitation(DCR).\nThe rationale behind 1:1:1 ratio-\nThe red blood cell component will improve oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues.\nFresh frozen plasma improves clotting by providing clotting factors V and VIII and fibrinogen.\nPlatelet transfusion is required if the platelet count is below 50,000 / high power field, significant blood loss or prolonged resuscitation.\nPediatric and Obstetric Anaesthesia\nQuestion 1:\nA 25-year-old woman was taken up for a cesarean section. Following the administration of spinal anaesthesia, she suddenly developed hypotension. Which of the following would be the vasopressor of choice for this patient?\nDopamine\nAdrenaline\nEphedrine\nPhenylephrine\nQuestion 2:\nIn pregnant women who are administered general anaesthesia, which of the following is the most common cause for mortality?\nHypotension\nPulmonary aspiration\nArrhythmias\nAmniotic fluid embolism\nQuestion 3:\nWhat is the rate of maternal mortality due to pulmonary aspiration in patients undergoing general anaesthesia?",

    "question_text": "\nd\nSolution to Question 1:\nPhenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice to manage hypotension caused by spinal anaesthesia in pregnancy.\nPhenylephrine produces lesser fetal acidosis and has lesser fetal transfer than\nephedrine. Ephedrine was recommended in the past; however, its use has declined since it is associated with fetal acidosis and base deficit.\nSolution to Question 2:\nPregnant women who undergo general anaesthesia are at increased risk of mortality from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.\nOther risk factors include failed intubation of the trachea and inadequate ventilation. General anaesthesia has a 1.7 times greater risk of maternal morbidity and mortality than regional anaesthesia. Maternal mortality associated with aspiration is 5-15%.\nMendelson's syndrome is chemical pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonitis caused by aspiration during anaesthesia, especially during pregnancy.\nSolution to Question 3:\nMaternal mortality associated with aspiration in patients under general anaesthesia is 5-15%.\nMendelson's syndrome is chemical pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonitis caused by aspiration during anesthesia, especially during pregnancy. The risk factors include:\nGastric volume &gt;25 mL (0.4 mL/kg)\nGastric pH &lt; 2.5\nMeasures to reduce the incidence of aspiration:\nAdministration of nonparticulate antacids like sodium citrate\nH2 receptor antagonists like intravenous ranitidine\nMetoclopramide\nSolution to Question 4:\nPropofol is the most common intravenous induction agent used in general anesthesia for cesarean delivery.\nPropofol can induce unconsciousness in approximately 45 seconds. Its administration does not affect neonatal Apgar scores with typical intravenous induction doses (2-2.5 mg/kg). Repeated or larger cumulative doses (9 mg/kg) are associated with significant newborn depression.\nOther options:\nOption B: Thiopentone was the most commonly used agent for induction before the introduction of propofol.\nOption C: Etomidate is not used as it can induce seizures in patients with reduced seizure thresholds. It is also associated with a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting.\nOption D: Ketamine is the preferred agent for patients with hemodynamic compromise as it helps maintain arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output due to central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.\nSolution to Question 5:\nGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred anaesthetic technique of choice in an emergency LSCS in a patient with placental abruption considering the emergency nature of the surgery and the possibility of hemodynamic instability due to massive blood loss.\nAdvantages of General anaesthesia include:\nA very rapid and reliable onset\nControl over the airway and ventilation\nMore comfortable for patients who have morbid fears of needles or surgery\nLess incidence of hypotension as compared to regional anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is preferred in emergency conditions such as:\nMassive bleeding (placenta previa or accreta, abruption placentae, or uterine rupture)\nCoagulopathy\nHemodynamic instability\nSevere fetal distress.\nDisadvantages/risks of general anaesthesia:\nPulmonary aspiration of gastric contents\nDifficult or failed intubation\nDrug exposure to the fetus.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of hemodynamic compromise secondary to uterine scar dehiscence. Ketamine is the preferred induction agent in this patient.\nKetamine is the preferred induction agent for patients with hemodynamic compromise as it helps maintain arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output due to sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.\nOther properties of ketamine are:\nDissociative anesthesia with profound analgesia\nPreserves laryngeal and pharyngeal reflex\nDoes not depress respiration\nBronchial dilatation\nOptions A and B: Propofol and thiopentone cause hypotension following induction.\nOption D: Etomidate, although cardiostable causes a mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance that is responsible for a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.\nSolution to Question 7:\nSuccinylcholine will be the preferred muscle relaxant in the given scenario.\nPregnancy is considered to be a state of 'full stomach' and therefore rapid sequence induction is preferred when undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia.\nSuccinylcholine is the preferred muscle relaxant in rapid sequence induction due to its following properties:\nRapid onset (30-45 seconds)\nThe short duration of action (metabolized by pseudocholinesterase)\nHighly ionized and poorly lipid-soluble (lower placental transfer to foetus).\nRocuronium can be used as an alternative to succinylcholine. It is the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent of choice for rapid sequence induction. It has a rapid onset(&lt;60\nseconds) and its duration of action can be terminated by the reversal agent sugammadex. But the use of rocuronium is associated with lower Apgar scores at 1 minute when compared with succinylcholine.\nSolution to Question 8:\nLumbar epidural is the most commonly used technique to produce labour analgesia because it can provide analgesia during the first stage of labour and also provide anaesthesia during vaginal delivery or cesarean section if necessary.\nFor adequate pain relief, the sensory block of T10-L1 is required during the first stage of labour and S2-S4 is required during the second stage. The epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace sufficiently provides T10\u2013S5 neural blockade.\nOption A: Pudendal nerve block is given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the baby to provide analgesia to the vulva and anus . However, it has no effect on the pain of contractions. It is also given before repair of episiotomy or perineal lacerations.\nOption B: Spinal anaesthesia for labour analgesia has the advantage of a rapid and reliable onset of the neural blockade, and it is technically easier to administer compared to epidural analgesia. However, repeated intrathecal injections may be required for a prolonged labour, thus increasing the risk of post-dural puncture headache.\nOption C: Caudal epidural is largely abandoned to provide pain relief in obstetrics. It requires large volumes of a local anaesthetic to anaesthetize upper lumbar and lower thoracic dermatomes to provide adequate labour analgesia. Though rare, accidental puncture of the fetus is a possibility.\nSolution to Question 9:\nBupivacaine is the preferred local anaesthetic (LA) agent for labour analgesia.\nBupivacaine is preferred over lidocaine, chloroprocaine, and cocaine for labour analgesia because of its following properties:\nDifferential blockade (less motor blockade as compared to sensory blockade). This preferred motor function is useful as voluntary push down efforts by the patient may lead to better delivery outcomes.\nLong duration of action (infrequent top-ups).\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe preferred combination used for epidural analgesia during labour is bupivacaine with fentanyl.\nThis is because, doses of local anaesthetics can be reduced by combining them with opioids like fentanyl or sufentanil.\nThe lesser concentration of local anaesthetic used leads to greater preservation of motor function and makes ambulation of the patient possible (walking or mobile epidural). Also, by reducing the concentration of the drugs, adverse effects like hypotension and drug toxicity are minimized.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe concentration of bupivacaine used to provide labour analgesia, when used along with fentanyl is 0.0625%.\nThe required doses of local anaesthetics can be reduced if it is used in combination with opioids like fentanyl or sufentanil.\nConcentration of LA used in epidural:\nThe dose of opioid used in epidural:\nFentanyl : 2\u20133 mcg/mL\nSufentanil: 0.3\u20130.5 mcg/mL\nDrug\nConcentratio ns\nWithout opi oid\nWith opioid\nBupivaca ine",

    "question_text": "0625-0.2\n%\nSolution to Question 12:\nVery dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:400,000 to 1:800,000) is used along with local anaesthetics for labour epidural analgesia.\nEpidural epinephrine can provide vasoconstriction which would delay the vascular uptake of local anaesthetic and opioid. Additionally, it can activate \uf0b0 2-adrenergic receptors and thus produce analgesia on its own.\nEpinephrine, used along with local anaesthetics at a concentration of 5 \uf06dg/mL or 1:200,000 may be associated with uterine artery vasoconstriction which can adversely affect the fetus and delay the progress of labour. Hence epinephrine at this dose is used only for test dose (15 \uf06dg/mL or 3 ml of 1:200,000). A test dose is given to rule out the intravascular placement of epidural catheter following the procedure.\nSolution to Question 13:\nSpinal anaesthesia is preferred over other techniques for an elective cesarean section. Advantages of spinal anaesthesia over general anaesthesia:\nLess neonatal exposure to potentially depressant drugs\nA decreased risk of maternal pulmonary aspiration\nAn awake mother at the birth of her child\nSpinal opioids can be used for postoperative pain relief Advantages of spinal anaesthesia over epidural anaesthesia:\nRapid and predictable block\nComplete block (lesser failure rate)\nLesser risk of systemic toxicity or high spinal due to accidental intravascular or intratheca injection seen with epidural anesthesia\nMore cost-effective\nParacervical block is used for labour analgesia, but not for elective cesarean section. Side effects include transient fetal bradycardia, maternal local anaesthetic toxicity, and accidental injection of local anaesthetic into the presenting fetal head.\nSolution to Question 14:\nSpinal anesthesia is preferred over other techniques for the appendectomy in the second trimester. Total anesthetic drug exposure is least with spinal anesthesia over others.\nGeneral anesthesia is associated with a greater risk of:\nPulmonary aspiration of gastric contents\nDifficult or failed intubation\nDrug exposure to the fetus Epidural anesthesia has the risk of:\nAccidental intravascular injection\nAccidental intrathecal injection\nAlthough spinal anesthesia is preferred in most situations, the choice between general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia is to be individualized. In general, spinal anesthesia is appropriate for open appendectomies and general anesthesia for laparoscopic appendectomies.\nSolution to Question 15:\nEpidural anaesthesia is the preferred anaesthetic technique in this patient who is likely to be suffering from preeclampsia.\nEpidural anaesthesia is the first choice anaesthetic technique for patients with pre-eclampsia during labour, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section. One major prerequisite for its usage is normal platelet count (minimum 100,000/\uf06dL) and normal coagulation.\nIt has been shown to decrease catecholamine secretion and improve uteroplacental perfusion up to 75% in these patients, provided hypotension is avoided.\nOption A: General anaesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with complications.\nOption B: Spinal anaesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal anaesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia.\nOption D: Caudal anaesthesia is generally unpopular in obstetric anaesthesia because of painful needle placement, high failure rates, potential contamination at the injection site, and risks of accidental fetal injection.\nSolution to Question 16:\nGeneral anaesthesia is the technique of choice for elective caesarean section in a patient with coarctation of the aorta.\nIn coarctation of the aorta, any decrease in cardiac output or cardiac return is deleterious to the fetus because the placental circulation is already compromised on account of coarctation.\nRegional anaesthesia should be avoided in the patient with coarctation of the aorta because hypotension is the most common side effect of these anaesthesias.\nLocal anaesthesia with nerve blocks does not provide adequate anaesthesia for caesarean section.\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe cricoid cartilage is the narrowest point of the airway (larynx is funnel-shaped) in children under 5 years of age.\nIn adults, it was earlier believed that the narrowest part of the airway is the glottis. But, now it has been discovered that the subglottic region at the level of the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion in about 70% of adults.\nSalient features of pediatric airway:\nNeonates are obligate nasal breathers (up to 5 months).\nNasal passages are narrower.\nLarger tongue in relation to the oropharynx (airway obstruction and difficult intubation may be a problem).\nThe larynx is placed higher in the neck (the glottis is at a vertebral level of C4 versus C6 in adults), so straight laryngoscope blades are preferred.\nA short, omega-shaped epiglottis, and a shorter trachea and neck.\nVocal cords are angulated and so if a tracheal tube is passed blindly instead of passing into the trachea it could lodge in the anterior commissure.\nSolution to Question 18:\nRocuronium is considered to be the drug of choice to provide muscle relaxation during routine rapid sequence induction or intubation in pediatric patients with foreign body aspiration.\nIt has a faster onset and can be administered intramuscularly. Its long duration of action is a disadvantage. Sugammadex is a specific reversal agent that can terminate the action of rocuronium.\nOption A: Succinylcholine is used for rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia because of its rapid onset and ultra-short duration of action. It is the shortest acting muscle relaxant but it is not used for routine intubation in children due to its many adverse effects like rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and malignant hyperthermia.\nOption C: Vecuronium action is prolonged in small children due to immature hepatic and renal function.\nOption D: Atracurium or cisatracurium may be preferred in young infants, particularly for short procedures, because they undergo Hoffman elimination leading to a short duration of action.\nBesides, they do not require intact hepatic and renal functions.\nSolution to Question 19:\nDesflurane is a highly pungent gas and can produce laryngospasm if used for inhalational induction. Hence it is not used as an induction agent.\nThe incidence of laryngospasm following desflurane induction is almost 50%. It is usually used for maintenance of anaesthesia only and is of particular value in obese patients, neurosurgical and spinal fusion procedures where rapid awakening is required for neurological function assessment.\nOption A: Halothane is hepatotoxic but can be used (Sevoflurane is preferred)\nOption B: Sevoflurane is the preferred inhalational agent for induction in the pediatric age group. Cardiovascular depression, bradycardia, and arrhythmias are less frequent with sevoflurane than with halothane and hence the former is preferred.\nOption D: Nitrous oxide has the highest minimum alveolar concentration and so it is the least potent. It is used in combination with other potent inhaled anaesthetics to reduce their dose. It can be used to hasten the induction of anaesthesia along with other induction agents.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe clinical features and neck radiograph (steeple sign) are suggestive of laryngotracheobronchitis\n(croup) in the child and halothane is the preferred agent used for induction in this condition.\nNormally sevoflurane and halothane are agents used for induction in children. But in a child with airway obstruction like croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), rapid induction is contraindicated.\nTo perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in such children, slow induction of anaesthesia is required before the child becomes sufficiently anaesthetized. Moreover, halothane has a slower excretion than sevoflurane, which provides sufficient time for airway management.\nThe therapeutic index of sevoflurane is higher than halothane (myocardial depression, sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmias, halothane hepatitis) and hence is preferred for routine cases. However in certain underdeveloped countries, due to its cost-effectiveness, halothane is preferred.\nSolution to Question 21:\nMethohexitone has the potential to cause seizures, hence it is avoided in children with temporal lobe epilepsy.\nIntravenous administration of methohexitone can cause burning, hiccups, apnea, and extrapyramidal-like movements. Due to its potential to cause seizures, it is used to therapeutically induce seizures in electroconvulsive therapy in adults.\nOption D: Ketamine is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial tension and better avoided in epileptic patients due to ketamine-induced myoclonic and seizure-like activity.\nOptions A and C: Propofol and thiopentone have anti-convulsant property.\nNote: This is a controversial MCQ. Among the above options, methohexitone is the most specific answer.\nSolution to Question 22:\nFentanyl is the most commonly used opioid in infants and children due to its rapid onset and short duration of action.\nTermination of its effects is due to rapid redistribution and elimination. It has the advantage of maintaining cardiovascular stability while providing anaesthesia. But, fentanyl induced bradycardia may require treatment with atropine/glycopyrrolate since the cardiac output of neonates is determined by the heart rate.\nOption A: Morphine leads to greater respiratory depression in neonates due to slower clearance of morphine.\nOption B: Meperidine / Pethidine is not used in children since long term or repeated administration of the drug leads to seizures due to the accumulation of its metabolite-normeperidine.\nOption D: Sufentanil is usually preferred for cardiac anaesthesia.\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe clinical scenario is suggestive of pyloric stenosis and the child should be pretreated with atropine if suxamethonium is used during the surgery.\nFor surgical repair in children with pyloric stenosis, either of the following two techniques can be done:\nRapid-sequence induction - if suxamethonium (2mg/kg) is used, atropine (0.02 mg/kg) should be given because children are more susceptible than adults to bradycardia and sinus node arrest associated with suxamethonium.\nAwake intubation - preserves airway reflexes\nThe classically described rapid sequence technique (preoxygenation, cricoid pressure, and avoiding mask ventilation) is not appropriate for an infant with pyloric stenosis.\nOpton A: Aspiration of gastric contents is done by suctioning with a wide bore vented catheter before induction of anaesthesia to remove 98% of gastric contents.\nOption B: Cricoid pressure can distort the anatomy making laryngoscopy difficult, hence avoided. If it is applied and there is no clear view of the larynx then the pressure should be relaxed.\nOption D: Infants rapidly desaturate compared to adults due to greater oxygen consumption and smaller functional residual capacity. This means that gentle bag-mask ventilation is required prior to laryngoscopy to avoid hypoxemia and bradycardia.\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe preferred sedative premedication in children is midazolam.\nIt is preferred as it has a shorter elimination half-life (2 hours) and has the advantage of producing anterograde amnesia. It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It is usually administered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents.\nOther sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, temazepam and ketamine.\nOption A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability of short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation in children with pain.\nOption B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that would prolong its action in young children.\nOption D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in pediatric patients.\nNote- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause hallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is administered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam).\nSolution to Question 25:\nMorphine is not commonly recommended for induction of anaesthesia in children, especially below the age of 6 months.\nMost commonly used induction agents in children:\nInhalational agents:\nNitrous oxide\nHalothane\nSevoflurane Intravenous agents:\nPropofo\nThiopentone\nEtomidate\nKetamine\nSolution to Question 26:\nKetamine is the agent of choice for induction of anesthesia in patients with hypovolemia.\nIt helps to maintain arterial pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output via central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine.\nThe following are contraindications for ketamine:\nActive upper respiratory infection (URI)\nIncreased intracranial pressure\nOpen-globe injury (only intravenous induction agent which raises intraocular pressure)\nPsychiatric or seizure disorder\nComplications of Anaesthesia\nQuestion 1:\nWhich of the following drugs would you avoid in a patient with a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting?\nDexamethasone\nPropofo\nNitrous oxide\nOndansetron\nQuestion 2:\nWhich of the following should you suspect as the most common anaphylactic agent during anesthesia?\nAntibiotics\nPropofo\nLatex\nRocuronium\nQuestion 3:\nThe use of which of the following drugs is unlikely to trigger an anaphylaxis reaction in a patient?\nRocuronium\nProcaine\nFurosemide\nFentany\nQuestion 4:\nA 67-year-old patient underwent a CABG procedure. He started shivering within 15 minutes of shifting him to the post-operative ward. His temperature was 35.5-degrees Celcius. Which\nof the following agents can be used to treat this patient?",

Penicillins and cephalosporins are the most common causes of anaphylaxis among antibiotics.\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe use of fentanyl is unlikely to cause an anaphylactic reaction. True allergic reactions to opioids like fentanyl are very rare.\nThe most common cause of anaphylactic reactions during anesthesia is antibiotics (especially penicillin and cephalosporin), followed by neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium).\nAmino ester local anesthetics (procaine) exhibit allergic reactions due to the metabolite PABA. Sulfa drugs like sulfonamide antibiotics, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and captopril also exhibit allergy in surgical patients.\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe clinical features are suggestive of postoperative hypothermia and shivering in this\npatient. Remifentanil is known to cause postoperative shivering when given in high doses and has no role in the treatment of this patient.\nPostoperative hypothermia is defined as a core temperature &lt; 36\u00b0C. Postoperative shivering is usually, but not always, associated with hypothermia. The primary cause of postoperative shivering is perioperative hypothermia. The most efficient way to reduce post-anaesthetic shivering is to prevent hypothermia by avoiding cold epidural and intravenous fluids.\nTreatment-\nMeperidine is the most effective treatment for post-anesthetic hypothermia and shivering.\nOpioids(Tramadol), ondansetron, clonidine, physostigmine and ketamine have been shown to be effective in abolishing shivering.\nIntraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine has been shown to be an effective prophylactic.\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe most common preventable cause of anesthetic mishaps is human error. Common human errors include:\nUnrecognized breathing circuit disconnection\nMistaken drug administration\nAirway mismanagement\nAnesthesia machine misuse\nFluid mismanagement\nIntravenous line disconnection\nEquipment malfunctions that can cause preventable anesthetic accidents are:\nBreathing circuit malfunction\nMonitoring device malfunction\nVentilator dysfunction\nAnesthesia machine malfunction\nFaulty laryngoscope\nUnpreventable mishaps include sudden death syndrome and fatal idiosyncratic drug reactions.\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe most common adverse effect persisting following day-care anaesthesia is drowsiness. Adverse effects after day-care anesthesia-\nDrowsiness(most common)\nSore throat\nMyalgia\nHeadache\nDizziness\nNausea and vomiting Cardiovascular adverse effects -\nHypotension\nHypertension\nArrhythmias\nCardiac arrest Respiratory complications -\nHypoxemia\nLaryngospasm\nBronchospasm\nAspiration\nPulmonary edema\nPneumothorax (rare)\nSolution to Question 7:\nWell-controlled asthma is not a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications. Risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications:\nAge &gt;70 years\nCOPD (uncontrolled)\nNeck, upper abdominal, Aortic, neurologic surgical procedures\nProlonged procedure &gt;2 hours\nGeneral anesthesia with intubation\nBMI &gt; 30\nAlbumin concentration &lt; 35 g/L\nInability to walk two blocks on level land or one flight of stairs\nSolution to Question 8:\nIschemic optic neuropathy is the most common cause of perioperative vision loss.\nIt is usually seen after spine surgeries in the prone position, radical neck dissections and following cardiopulmonary bypass.\nSymptoms: Reduced visual acuity, rarely complete blindness; usually presents on awakening from anesthesia.\nPreoperative risk factors:\nDiabetes, hypertension\nSmoking\nCoronary artery disease. Intraoperative risk factors:\nAnaemia\nHypotension\nProne position\nProlonged duration of surgery\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe surgeon is concerned about injury to the ulnar nerve which can be prevented by positioning the forearm in supination compared to pronation. The ulnar nerve is the most commonly injured peripheral nerve following anesthesia.\nOther commonly injured nerves include\nPeroneal nerve\nBrachial plexus\nCommon peroneal nerve\nSciatic nerves\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe fluid of choice for resuscitation in burns patients is Ringer lactate in the first 24 hours followed by albumin and 5% dextrose.\nThis is in contrast to blunt and penetrating trauma patients in whom colloids (albumin,\nhydroxyethyl starch) hypertonic saline, and blood are preferred.\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe patient needs to be resuscitated with 3L of fluid (ringer lactate) over the first 8 hours. According to ATLS 10th edition 2018, the resuscitation formula used in thermal burns is 2 mL/kg\n\u00d7 % total body surface area (TBSA) over 24 hours.\nHalf the volume over the first 8 hours: 1 mL/kg \u00d7 % TBSA Remaining volume over the next 16 hours: 1 mL/kg \u00d7 % TBSA\nIn the given question for a patient who weighs 70 kg, with a TBSA of 40%, 1\u00d770\u00d740= 2800 mL ~",

    "question_text": "\nLactate metabolizes into bi carbonate in the liver\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe patient must be given an emergency blood transfusion with Type O Rh-negative blood\n(universal donor)\nIf the recipient\u2019s blood type and Rh status is not known with certainty and transfusion must be started before determination, type O Rh-negative (universal donor) red cells may be used.\nType O negative blood is preferred because it lacks the A and B and Rh antigens and thus it cannot be hemolyzed by anti-A, anti-B, or anti-D antibodies in the recipient\u2019s blood.\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe most likely cause of bleeding in this patient who has received multiple PRBC transfusions is dilutional thrombocytopenia.\nThe most common cause of nonsurgical bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. Massive transfusion is most often defined as the need to transfuse one to two times the patient\u2019s blood volume. For most adult patients, that is the equivalent of 10\u201320 units.\nMajor trauma or blood loss will initiate a cascade of coagulation abnormalities, including a consumptive coagulopathy from tissue hypoperfusion as manifested by increased protein C levels. This coagulopathy is caused by a combination of factors, of which the most important are the dilution of coagulation factors by volume administration e.g., crystalloid, colloid, PRBC, and the duration of hypotension and hypoperfusion.\nConcurrent transfusion of packed red cells, plasma, and platelets can be done to avoid dilutional coagulopathy.\nSolution to Question 19:\nPRBC transfusion is to be done after warming it to a temperature of 37\u00b0C.\nPacked RBCs are stored at 1-6\u00b0C. Transfusion at this temperature will lead to profound hypothermia. If the body temperature decreases to less than 30\u00b0C, ventricular irritability and cardiac arrest may occur. Shivering from even mild hypothermia increases metabolic demands and is counterproductive to tissue perfusion, especially in settings where anemia or hypoperfusion is contributing to tissue ischemia.\nHypothermia together with low levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in stored blood can cause a marked leftward shift of the hemoglobin\u2013oxygen dissociation curve which can lead to tissue hypoxia.\nThe ideal method of warming blood is to pass it through plastic coils or cassettes in a warm water bath(37\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C) or warming plates.\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe blood component with a maximum risk of bacterial contamination is platelet concentrates as they are stored at room temperature of 20\u00b0C-24\u00b0C. Hence, they are at maximum risk of bacterial overgrowth and consequent sepsis.\nWith the incidence of 1 in 2000, any fever occurring within 6 hours of a platelet transfusion is likely to be sepsis from the use of stored platelets.\nSolution to Question 21:\nPost blood transfusion syphilis is most likely related to the use of platelet concentrate.\nThe causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum, cannot survive in storage at 10 to 16\u00b0C. So, it does not survive in most blood components except platelet concentrates, because platelets are stored at room temperature.\nSolution to Question 22:\nPacked red blood cell (PRBC) component has a hematocrit of 70%. Salient points on PRBCs:\nObtained after centrifugation of whole blood.\nOne unit of whole blood yields 250 mL of packed red cells with a hematocrit of 70%\nSaline preservative is added to this bringing a total volume of 350 mL\nThis is stored at 1-6\u00b0C.\nBlood with some rare phenotypes can be stored by freezing the packed cells in hypertonic glycerol solution, which makes it available for 10 years.\nEach unit of PRBC is expected to raise hemoglobin by 1 g/dL The image given below shows the components of whole blood.\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nIrradiation of granulocytes before transfusion does not reduce acute hemolytic reaction as it is due to attack on the transfused donor RBCs by recipient's antibodies and complements.\nSimilarly, the risk of bacterial contamination of platelets and transfusion-related acute lung injury\n(TRALI) has not decreased with leukoreduction.\nIrradiation of granulocytes or use of leukoreduced blood components has several advantages over the use of packed red blood cells:\nDecreased risk of graft versus host disease-which is due to engraftment of donor lymphocytes from the transfused blood products leading to an immune reaction against recipient tissues\nReduces chances of febrile reactions\nDecreases re-perfusion injury (myocardium; after heart by-pass)\nDecreases transmission of cytomegalovirus\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe incidence of anaphylactoid reactions is least with hydroxyethyl starch. The colloids are of two types:\nBlood-derived- human albumin and plasma protein fractions\nSemisynthetic- dextran, gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe highest incidence of anaphylactic reactions is seen with gelatin. Gelatin is a semisynthetic colloid obtained by hydrolysis of bovine collagen.\nHydroxyethyl Starch (Hetastarch) is non-antigenic and rarely causes anaphylactoid reactions.\nSolution to Question 26:\nDesflurane, being an inhalational anesthetic, is a triggering factor for malignant hyperthermia.\nSolution to Question 27:\nAll of the above agents can trigger malignant hyperthermia.\nMalignant hyperthermia is a genetic(autosomal dominant) hypermetabolic muscle disease. Triggering agents include\nInhaled general anesthetics\nEther\nHalothane\nMethoxyflurane\nEnflurane\nIsoflurane\nDesflurane\nSevoflurane\nDepolarizing muscle relaxants\nSuccinylcholine\nSolution to Question 28:\nHyperthermia is a late sign of malignant hyperthermia. Clinical Manifestations of Malignant Hyperthermia: Early Signs:\nElevated end-tidal carbon dioxide\nTachypnea and/or tachycardia\nMasseter spasm, if succinylcholine has been used\nGeneralized muscle rigidity\nMixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis\nProfuse sweating\nMottling of skin\nCardiac arrhythmias\nUnstable blood pressure Late Signs\nHyperkalemia\nRapid increase of core body temperature- body temperature rises by 1\u00b0C every 5 minutes\nElevated creatine phosphokinase levels\nGross myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria\nCardiac arrest\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nSolution to Question 29:\nDantrolene sodium is the drug of choice for malignant hyperthermia, but it is to be reconstituted with sterile distilled water and not saline as it can precipitate in saline or other salt solutions.\nIt is given at a dose of 2.5 mg/ kg intravenously and can be repeated every 5-10 minutes (up to 10 mg/kg) until the attack subsides.\nAll anesthetic agents should be cut off and the patient is given 100% oxygen. Bicarbonate at a dose of 1 to 4 mEq/kg IV can be used to treat metabolic acidosis.\nIf the body temperature is high, it should be brought down using cold intravenous fluids, cooling body cavities with sterile iced fluids, surface cooling with ice packs and cooling blankets.",
