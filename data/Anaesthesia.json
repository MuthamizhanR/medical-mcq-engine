This is because the cycle of 30 chest compressions before rescue breathing delays ventilation for only 15 to 20 seconds.\nDuring cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. In adults, the ratio is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\n\nIn infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants.\n\n\n",

This is because the heart is temporarily stunned by a defibrillator shock and so chest compressions would benefit the patient by providing coronary blood flow during this period.\nDefibrillation involves delivering an electrical current between two pads placed on the chest so as to interrupt disorganized cardiac activity and restore an organized cardiac rhythm or asystole for at least 5 seconds. It is of utmost necessity to defibrillate immediately because the chances of survival decrease by 7-10% every minute without defibrillation.\nIf after 2 minutes, the rhythm remains the same, then another shock is delivered. Chest compression and rescue breaths are resumed and 1 mg epinephrine is administered.\nConsideration is given for an advanced airway placement.\nIf after 2 minutes the rhythm still remains the same, the first dose of amiodarone 300mg bolus is given.\nWith the next cycle of CPR, a shock is delivered and 1 mg of epinephrine is given.

Thus it doesn\u2019t have much of a survival benefit.\nEpinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest.\nThe first dose of epinephrine,1 mg IV, is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered and it is continued every 3-5 minutes.\nIf this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150 mg given if necessary\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 8:\n\nA 58-year-old man presented to the casualty with complaints of increasing shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and palpitations. He had an irregularly irregular pulse and blood pressure was 120/70mm Hg. His ECG is given below. What is the treatment of choice?\n\n\nImmediate defibrillation\nSynchronized cardioversion\nIV adenosine\nIV ibutilide\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment of choice is IV Ibutilide.\nIbutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinus rhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period.\nIt is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can be administered 10 minutes after the first.\nIf there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment of choice.\nCardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronized with the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration of shock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized.\nHowever, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travel from the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium at once to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made to interrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node can take back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity.\nCardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent such as midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse is imminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should be preferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedative agents.\nEnergy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic or biphasic.\n\nMonophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasic defibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electrically opposite direction for the second half.\nBiphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistent magnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies than monophasic waveform defibrillators.\nEnergy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energy requirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010.\nAtrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows:\n200 Joules for monophasic devices\n120-200 Joules for biphasic devices\nAtrial flutter energy requirements are as follows:\n100 Joules for monophasic devices\n50-100 Joules for biphasic devices\nVentricular tachycardia with pulse energy requirements are as follows:\n200 Joules for monophasic devices\n100 Joules for biphasic devices\nVentricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia energy requirements are as follows:\n360 Joules for monomorphic devices\n120-200 Joules for biphasic devices\n\nIndications for electrical card ioversion\nIndications for defibrillation\nSupraventricular tachycardia( atrioventricular nodal reentr ant tachycardia [AVNRT] and atrioventricular reentrant ta chycardia [AVRT])Atrial fibril lationAtrial flutter(types I an d II)Ventricular tachycardia( with a pulse)Any patient with re-entranttachycardia withna rrow or wide QRScomplex (v entricular rate >150 bpm) wh o isunstable(eg, ischemic che st pain, acute pulmonary ede ma, hypotension, acute altere d mental status, signs of shoc k)\nPulseless ventricular tachycar dia (VT)Ventricular fibrillatio n (VF)Cardiac arrestdue to or resulting in VF\n\n\n\n\n",

The next line of management is to administer procainamide, class IA antiarrhythmic drug.\nAntiarrhythmic therapy for stable wide QRS tachycardia include procainamide, amiodarone, or sotalol. Synchronized cardioversion is considered when the patient is unstable.\nWhen a patient is in tachyarrhythmia typically with a heart rate of \uf0b3150 per minute, the initial intervention consists of identifying and treating the underlying cause. This includes:\nMaintaining a patent airway and assisting breathing as necessary\nAdministering oxygen if hypoxemic\nAttaching cardiac monitor to identify rhythm; monitor blood pressure and oximetry\nWhen there is persistent tachyarrhythmia, the management is as depicted by the flowchart (based on the AHA guidelines) below:\n\n\n\nOption B: Adenosine is used in regular narrow complex tachycardia.\nOption C: Lidocaine has limiting side effects and, increase the overall mortality risk.\nOption D: It is the treatment for immediately life-threatening arrhythmias with which the patient does not have a pulse, ie ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).\n\n\n",

It is of two types: the self-inflating bags with a reservoir of 1.5 L and the non-self-inflating bags with a reservoir of 1, 2 or 3 L.\nThe disadvantage is high cost and poor patient tolerability due to high flow. The other fixed performance devices include venturi mask, air-entraining nebulizers, and high flow air oxygen systems.\nThe nasal cannula, non\u2013rebreathing mask, and nasal mask are low flow variable performance systems. Oxygen is delivered at a low, fixed flow which is only a portion of the inspired gas mixture. They are cheap with better patient tolerability. The disadvantage is that the FiO2 delivered cannot be accurately predicted, so they are suitable for patients with stable breathing patterns.\n\nHigh flow systems\nLow flow systems\nFixed performance systems\nVariable performance system s\nExamples:venturi maskair-en training nebulizershigh flow air oxygen systemsanaestheti c bag\nExamples:nasal cannulanon\u2013 rebreathing masknasal mask\n\n\n",

Hepatic artery vasoconstriction and increase in hepatic arterial resistance are seen with halothane.\nHalothane also reduces hepatic oxygen delivery and hepatic venous oxygen saturation. This is because of the greater reduction in cardiac output caused by halothane than the other volatile agents.\nHepatic arterial buffer response(HABF) is an autoregulatory mechanism in the liver. When portal blood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial blood flow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow. Halothane disrupts this regulatory mechanism, which is best preserved with sevoflurane or isoflurane.\nDesflurane and sevoflurane have the least significant effects on total hepatic blood flow and oxygen delivery.

However, this vasoconstriction occurs only in normal areas. The blood vessels in the ischemic area remain dilated due to ischemia-induced vasomotor paralysis and are unaffected by thiopentone. This leads to redistribution of blood flow from normal to ischemic areas in the brain. This is called the Robin Hood phenomenon.\n\n\n",

Ketamine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and preserves upper airway reflexes.\nKetamine increases heart rate, arterial pressure, and cardiac output by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine. It is the only anesthetic that increases peripheral arteriolar resistance and thus reduces redistribution of hypothermia in hypovolemic patients.\nContraindications of ketamine:\nRaised intracranial pressure\nOpen globe injury (raises intraocular pressure)\nVascular aneurysm surgery (possible sudden change in arterial blood pressure)\nPsychiatric diseases - schizophrenia\nHyperthyroidism (exaggerated elevations in blood pressure, heart rate)\nIschemic heart disease (increase in myocardial oxygen consumption)\n\n\n",

Na channels exist in 3 states:\nResting (non-conducting)\nOpen (conducting)\nInactivated (non conducting)\nLocal anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. They bind to the Na channel from the inner aspect in cationic form.\nThey bind to the \uf0b0 subunit of Na channel and inhibit the conformational changes associated with channel opening, thereby preventing Na influx.

Although these toxins are chemically distinct, they are exceedingly potent and have similar mechanisms of action.\nWhile local anesthetics inhibit sodium channel activity by binding to the inner pore (from intracellular side), these toxins bind to the outer pore of the channel. As a result, the action potential is blocked.\nUnlike local anesthetics, these neurotoxins are very specific to neuronal Na channels, hence cardiac and neurological side effects are low.\nTreatment includes gastric lavage, vasopressors.

What advantage of the preferred drug?\nMore potent\nLess nephrotoxic\nLess cardiotoxic\nMore profound motor blockade\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nRopivacaine is less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine is S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine. The R(+) isomer of bupivacaine is responsible\nfor cardiotoxicity. Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic and has a higher safety profile than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine has a shorter duration of action and produces less motor block than bupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine. Epidural ropivacaine is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine.\nRopivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both spinal and epidural).\nNote: Levobupivacaine is another S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, with less cardiotoxicity.

Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic and has a higher safety profile than bupivacaine.\nOption C: Ropivacaine has a shorter duration of action and produces less motor block than bupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is less potent than bupivacaine. Epidural ropivacaine is 40 % less potent than bupivacaine.\nOption D: Ropivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both spinal and epidural).\nNote: Levobupivacaine is another S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, with less cardiotoxicity.

Prior to this, it was legal only in Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.\nEuthanasia involves the administration of medication by someone other than the patient for the purpose of ending the patient\u2019s life in the belief that it is best for the patient (but not necessarily at the specific request of the patient).\nInvoluntary euthanasia, which is done against the patient\u2019s consent, is illegal in all countries and amounts to murder.\nTypes of euthanasia:\nActive euthanasia: Direct administration of a lethal substance to the patient by another party with merciful intent\nPassive euthanasia: Withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment either at the equest of the patient or when prolonging life is considered futile\nIndirect euthanasia: Prescription of painkillers that may be fatal in an attempt to relieve suffering\nPhysician-assisted suicide: A medical professional aiding a patient in terminating their life upon the patient's request/\n\nPreoperative Evaluation\n\n",

Distally, it terminates in the conus medullaris as the filum terminale (fibrous extension) and the cauda equina (neural extension).\nThe lumbar puncture during spinal anesthesia (a.k.a. sub-arachnoid block, intra-thecal block) is done below the level of L1 in adults (L2-3, L3-4, L4-5 interspace), to avoid potential needle trauma to the spinal cord.\n\n\n",

Although this may affect relative baricity of local anaesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimportant. Hence, this is the best answer to choose from the above options.\nOption A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anaesthetic.\nOption C: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors.\nOption D: Within the range of \u201cnormal-sized\u201d adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anaesthesia.

You know that the patient may have to remain seated for a while after administration of the spinal anaesthetic for insertion of the epidural\n\ncatheter.Which of the following will you use for spinal anaesthesia to reduce the chances of hemodynamic disturbances in this scenario?\n0.5% Bupivacaine with glucose\n0.5% Bupivacaine with fentanyl\n0.5% Bupivacaine with sterile water\n0.5% Plain bupivacaine\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nTo prevent hemodynamic disturbances, we must prevent the migration of the spinal block to upper thoracic segments. In the sitting position, this can be achieved by using a hyperbaric solution like bupivacaine with glucose.\nBaricity of local anesthetics refers to the specific gravity of the solution with respect to that of CSF.\nA hyperbaric solution (addition of glucose) of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, a hypobaric solution (addition of sterile water or fentanyl) is lighter than CSF and isobaric solution (plain or 1:1 CSF) has density same as that of CSF.\nHyperbaric solution tends to move to the dependent area of the spine. While a hypobaric solution moves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection.\nWith the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric solution moves caudally.\nIn clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia. A hypobaric solution is only used in prone jackknife position to specifically block the operative site around perineum during certain anorectal surgeries.\n",

The sacrococcygeal ligament covers the sacral hiatus that is created by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae.\nSacral hiatus is well appreciated in children. Hence, it is a common regional technique in paediatrics for procedures below the diaphragm, including urogenital, rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgery.\nIt may also be used for anorectal surgery in adults but it is technically challenging in adults.\n\n\nThe landmarks depicted in the image are in reference to caudal anaesthesia. It is a common regional technique in paediatrics for procedures below the diaphragm, including urogenital, rectal, inguinal, and lower extremity surgery.\nCaudal anaesthesia involves deposition of local anaesthetic in the caudal epidural space, accessed through the sacral hiatus. Sacral hiatus is formed by the unfused S4 and S5 laminae and is covered by the sacrococcygeal ligament.\nThe lines joining the posterior superior iliac spines and sacral hiatus make an equilateral triangle. The sacral hiatus is felt as a groove or notch above the coccyx and between two bony prominences, the sacral cornua.\nIt is better appreciated in children than in adults and hence it is a common regional technique among pediatric patients.\n\n\nRegional Anesthesia: Complications and Contraindications\n",

Which of the following is false about post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting associated?\nHistory of motion sickness is a risk factor\nElderly age groups are at lesser risk\nFemale patients are at higher risk\nIntrathecal morphine administration has the least incidence\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 1:\nIntrathecal morphine has a higher risk and incidence of nausea and vomiting among opioids as compared to fentanyl/sufentanil.\nThis is because hydrophilic opioids (morphine) remain in CSF for a prolonged duration than lipophilic opioids (fentanyl) and sensitize the central chemoreceptor trigger zone.\nThe Apfel score is used to predict the risk of developing postoperative nausea and vomiting\n(PONV). According to this, risk factors are:\nPost-operative use of opioids\nNon-smoker\nFemale gender\nHistory of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or motion sickness\nAdditional risk factors are the use of nitrous oxide as an inhalational anesthetic agent and the duration of anesthesia.\nOndansetron with or without dexamethasone is used in the management of this condition. The use of propofol in balanced or total IV anesthesia (TIVA) significantly reduces the incidence of PONV.\n\n\n",

So, it is safe to administer it to a patient on low dose aspirin.\nThis is because use of most antiplatelet agents (eg. Aspirin &amp; NSAIDs) is not associated with an increased risk of complications from centrineuraxial anaesthesia.\nLMWH administration must be stopped prophylactically (12 hours prior) and therapeutically (24 hours prior) to centrineuraxial anaesthesia. It can be done only after checking if the platelet count is normal (if LMWH has been administered for more than 4 days).

Raw: Question 7:\n\nWhich of the following is false regarding post-dural puncture headache?\nDue to intracranial hypotension\nUsually seen within first 72 hours\nRelieved on sitting\nCommon with cutting spinal needles\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 7:\nPost-dural puncture headache worsens with upright or sitting position and is relieved by supine position.\nPost-dural puncture headache is believed to result from puncture of the dura (unintentional or intentional) in the setting of neuraxial anaesthesia. This causes leakage of CSF from a dural defect eading to intracranial hypotension.\nThe characteristic feature of a post-dural puncture headache is the frontal or an occipital headache.\n\n\n",

What is the definitive treatment for the condition that she is suffering from?\nAnalgesics\nCaffeine\nSupine posture\nEpidural blood patch\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe scenario given in the question is most likely post-dural puncture headache(PDPH). The definitive treatment for post-dural puncture headache is epidural blood patch. The remaining options are conservative management approaches for PDPH.\nProcedure:\nIdeally, performed 24 hours after dural puncture and development of classic PDPH symptoms.\n15-20 mL of autologous blood is injected into the epidural space at same or one interspace below the level of the dural puncture.\nIt stops further leakage of CSF by either mass effect or coagulation. A second patch can be performed after 24-48 hours if needed. Approximately 90% of patients will respond to a single blood patch, and 90% of initial nonresponders will obtain relief from a second injection.\n\n\n",

Thus it is safer to use than propofol.\nOption C: Ketamine has been effectively used in trauma patients because it is a CNS stimulant. It has indirect cardiovascular effects due to central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine which is beneficial in acute shock.\n\n\n",

Rib fracture patients will have the following complications due to splinting and pain:\nHypoventilation\nHypoxia\nOther techniques to provide analgesia following rib fractures are intercostal nerve block and intrapleural block which necessitates multiple injections, which increases the risk for complications.\nThe complications include vascular puncture, pneumothorax, patient discomfort due to the need for palpation of the fractured rib during local anaesthetic (LA) administration. Also, LA toxicity can occur because of the high systemic absorption.\nOption A: General Anaesthesia is more invasive to manage patient with multiple rib fractures and has potentially more side effects and complications than Epidural Anaesthesia. Endotracheal intubation as treatment is reserved only for patients who cannot maintain an airway or maintain sufficient oxygen saturation.\nOption B: Spinal anaesthesia involves a high level of anaesthesia which is required to cover the thoracic dermatomes which would lead to high spinal or total spinal anaesthesia.\nOption D: Infraclavicular block is a brachial plexus block that is used for the upper limbs.\n\n\n",

This results in a right to left shunt through\n\nthe ventricular septal defect and consequent cyanosis.\nThe commonest symptoms are dyspnea on exertion and exercise intolerance and develop blue skin (cyanosis) when agitated and are known as tet spells. The patients assume a sitting posture (squatting) or knee-chest position as soon as they get dyspneic, which leads to temporary symptomatic relief.\nKetamine does not aggravate the right to left shunt seen in such cases.

Raw: Question 31:\n\nThe best type of anesthesia for pre eclampsia is:\nSpinal anesthesia\nEpidural anesthesia\nGeneral anesthesia\nCaudal block\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 31:\nContinuous epidural anesthesia is the first choice for most patients with preeclampsia during labor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean section.\nPre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thus continuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides, continuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decrease catecholamine secretion.\nBut one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal platelet count and normal coagulation. Coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia.\nMinimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 100,000/\uf06dL, but some cases can be taken up with a platelet count as low as 70,000/\uf06dL.\nGeneral anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with complications.\nSpinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia.\nSince the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned, epidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hence the best option here would be epidural anesthesia.\n\n\n\nIn DCR, the ratio of PRBC: fresh frozen plasma: platelets is 1:1:1.\nAdministering blood products in the appropriate ratios in order to facilitate resuscitation from trauma and avert trauma-induced coagulopathy is termed damage control resuscitation(DCR).\nThe rationale behind 1:1:1 ratio-\nThe red blood cell component will improve oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues.\nFresh frozen plasma improves clotting by providing clotting factors V and VIII and fibrinogen.\n\nPlatelet transfusion is required if the platelet count is below 50,000 / high power field, significant blood loss or prolonged resuscitation.\n\nPediatric and Obstetric Anaesthesia\n\n",

This is because regional anaesthesia produces profound hypotension which can lead to a fall in preload, afterload or both.\nMost general anaesthetics especially the volatile agents also cause vasodilation and hypotension which can be treated with escalating doses of vasopressors like phenylephrine.\nMild to moderate aortic stenosis are not contraindications to regional anaesthesia.

Which of the following is true about the condition?\nAll VAE can be detected clinically by a decrease in end tidal carbon dioxide\nA decrease in oxygen saturation will not always be seen, even with larger emboli\nPatients with left to right shunt, are susceptible to paradoxical air embolism\nThe surgeon has no role in the management of VAE\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe correct statement regarding venous air embolism (VAE) is, a decrease in oxygen saturation will not always be seen, even with larger emboli.\nVAE can occur when the pressure within an open vein is subatmospheric. It can occur in any position or procedure, whenever the wound is above the level of the heart. The incidence of venous air embolism is greater during sitting craniotomies than in craniotomies in any other position.\nOption A: Physiological monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide) have poor sensitivity and specificity and the clinical signs are manifested\nlate. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive method to monitor and can detect up to 0.02ml/kg of air embolism.\nOption C: Patients with a right to left shunt are susceptible to paradoxical air emboli which can result in a stroke or coronary occlusion.\nOption D: The surgeon should be notified immediately so that he or she can flood the surgical field with saline or pack it with wet gauzes and apply bone wax to the skull edges until the entry site is identified and occluded.\n\n\n",

Additionally, it can activate \uf0b0 2-adrenergic receptors and thus produce analgesia on its own.\nEpinephrine, used along with local anaesthetics at a concentration of 5 \uf06dg/mL or 1:200,000 may be associated with uterine artery vasoconstriction which can adversely affect the fetus and delay the progress of labour. Hence epinephrine at this dose is used only for test dose (15 \uf06dg/mL or 3 ml of 1:200,000).

Its long duration of action is a disadvantage. Sugammadex is a specific reversal agent that can terminate the action of rocuronium.\nOption A: Succinylcholine is used for rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia because of its rapid onset and ultra-short duration of action. It is the shortest acting muscle relaxant but it is not used for routine intubation in children due to its many adverse effects like rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and malignant hyperthermia.\nOption C: Vecuronium action is prolonged in small children due to immature hepatic and renal function.\nOption D: Atracurium or cisatracurium may be preferred in young infants, particularly for short procedures, because they undergo Hoffman elimination leading to a short duration of action.\nBesides, they do not require intact hepatic and renal functions.\n\n\n",

It is usually used for maintenance of anaesthesia only and is of particular value in obese patients, neurosurgical and spinal fusion procedures where rapid awakening is required for neurological function assessment.\nOption A: Halothane is hepatotoxic but can be used (Sevoflurane is preferred)\nOption B: Sevoflurane is the preferred inhalational agent for induction in the pediatric age group. Cardiovascular depression, bradycardia, and arrhythmias are less frequent with sevoflurane than with halothane and hence the former is preferred.\nOption D: Nitrous oxide has the highest minimum alveolar concentration and so it is the least potent.

But in a child with airway obstruction like croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), rapid induction is contraindicated.\nTo perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in such children, slow induction of anaesthesia is required before the child becomes sufficiently anaesthetized. Moreover, halothane has a slower excretion than sevoflurane, which provides sufficient time for airway management.\nThe therapeutic index of sevoflurane is higher than halothane (myocardial depression, sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmias, halothane hepatitis) and hence is preferred for routine cases. However in certain underdeveloped countries, due to its cost-effectiveness, halothane is preferred.\n\n\n",

If it is applied and there is no clear view of the larynx then the pressure should be relaxed.\nOption D: Infants rapidly desaturate compared to adults due to greater oxygen consumption and smaller functional residual capacity.

It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It is usually administered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents.\nOther sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, temazepam and ketamine.\nOption A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability of short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation in children with pain.\nOption B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that would prolong its action in young children.\nOption D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in pediatric patients.\nNote- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause hallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is administered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam).\n",

What is the preferred anaesthetic technique to ensure this patient has a painless labour?\nPudendal nerve block\nSpinal anesthesia\nCaudal anesthesia\nLumbar epidura\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nLumbar epidural is the most commonly used technique to produce labour analgesia because it can provide analgesia during the first stage of labour and also provide anaesthesia during vaginal delivery or cesarean section if necessary.\nFor adequate pain relief, the sensory block of T10-L1 is required during the first stage of labour and S2-S4 is required during the second stage. The epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace sufficiently provides T10\u2013S5 neural blockade.\nOption A: Pudendal nerve block is given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the baby to provide analgesia to the vulva and anus . However, it has no effect on the pain of contractions. It is also given before repair of episiotomy or perineal lacerations.\nOption B: Spinal anaesthesia for labour analgesia has the advantage of a rapid and reliable onset of the neural blockade, and it is technically easier to administer compared to epidural analgesia. However, repeated intrathecal injections may be required for a prolonged labour, thus increasing the risk of post-dural puncture headache.\nOption C: Caudal epidural is largely abandoned to provide pain relief in obstetrics. It requires large volumes of a local anaesthetic to anaesthetize upper lumbar and lower thoracic dermatomes to provide adequate labour analgesia. Though rare, accidental puncture of the fetus is a possibility.\n\n\n",

Before administration, you must make sure the unit of PRBC is at a temperature of\t.\n20\u00b0C\n6\u00b0C\n24\u00b0C\n37\u00b0C\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 19:\nPRBC transfusion is to be done after warming it to a temperature of 37\u00b0C.\nPacked RBCs are stored at 1-6\u00b0C. Transfusion at this temperature will lead to profound hypothermia. If the body temperature decreases to less than 30\u00b0C, ventricular irritability and cardiac arrest may occur. Shivering from even mild hypothermia increases metabolic demands and is counterproductive to tissue perfusion, especially in settings where anemia or hypoperfusion is contributing to tissue ischemia.\nHypothermia together with low levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in stored blood can cause a marked leftward shift of the hemoglobin\u2013oxygen dissociation curve which can lead to tissue hypoxia.\nThe ideal method of warming blood is to pass it through plastic coils or cassettes in a warm water bath(37\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C) or warming plates.\n\n\n",

It mandatory before radial artery cannulation and sometimes, before drawing blood for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.\nMethod:\nIt is performed by occluding the radial and ulnar arteries and asking the patient to make a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm.\nThen, the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. If the palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow.\n\n\n\n0.5 ml of Heparin is not added to the syringe before taking blood.\nVery little heparin is needed in the sample to prevent clotting; 0.05 to 0.10 ml of a dilute\nsolution will help prevent coagulation of 1 ml of blood without affecting its pH. This is achieved by drawing 0.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the syringe is sufficient for the procedure.\nHeparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.0, and the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter ABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains in the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG determination.\nNote:\nModified Allen's test positive indicates that the collateral blood flow is normal\nModified Allen's test negative indicates that the collateral blood flow is abnormal and an alternate site must be chosen.\n\n\nRespiratory Monitoring in Anaesthesia\n\n",

The presence of a pharyngeal pathology such as an abscess or tumor, or a pharyngeal obstruction is also a relative contraindication of LMA insertion.\nThe normal anatomic position of the LMA.\nThe proximal portion of the LMA rests upon the epiglottis, whereas the distal end or, the tip extends into the pharynx at the upper end of the esophagus. The opening on the laryngeal mask overlies the laryngeal inlet.\n\n\n\n\n",

What will be ideal choice of muscle relaxant that will be used for intubation?\nRocuronium\nSuccinylcholine\nVecuronium\nCisatracurium\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 17:\nRapid sequence intubation for a patient with a hiatus hernia should be facilitated by the use of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant such as rocuronium, to prevent an increase in the intragastric pressure (IGP).\nSuccinylcholine is usually the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI since it has a rapid onset and short duration of action. However, regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents are likely, due to fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscles. Hence, endotracheal intubation may be facilitated with rocuronium before succinylcholine to decrease this risk.\nGenerally, an IGP &gt; 28 cm H2O is required to overcome the competence of the gastroesophageal junction. However, when the normal oblique angle of entry of the esophagus into the stomach is altered, the IGP required for regurgitation is much lesser.\nConditions that predispose to raised IGP are:\nPregnancy\nAscite\nBowel obstruction\nHiatus hernia\n\n\n",

Hence, N2O gauge will read full as long as there is liquid in the tank. After which the pressure falls until the cylinder is exhausted.\n\n\n\nN2O pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth, and empty cylinder.\nThe contents of N2O cylinders can be accurately measured by weighing the cylinders rather than by pressure gauge.\nTo measure the content, the weight of an empty cylinder, known as Tare weight is subtracted from the actual weight of the cylinder.\n\n\n\n\nO2 pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth and empty cylinder.\nIn a cylinder containing a non-liquefied gas such as Oxygen, the pressure in the cylinder decreases as the contents are used.

HME acts as an artificial nose, which traps the exhaled water vapor and heat passively by its hygroscopic material, and thus conserves heat and adds moisture to the inhaled gases.\nActive humidifiers act by allowing air passage inside a heated water reservoir. These devices are placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air is loaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient\u2019s airway.\nSome humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission of microbes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients.\n\nThe disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit.\n\n\nShown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material.\n\n\n\nShown above is the placement of HME filter in the breathing circuit.\n\n\n",

    "explanation": "AI Processing Failed. Raw: Question 9:\n\nFor effective chest compression during CPR, where should the hands of the healthcare provider ideally be placed?\nUpper half of sternum\nMiddle third of sternum\nLower half of sternum\nUpper third of sternum\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 9:\nIn children and adults, chest compressions are performed by locating the xiphoid process and placing the heel of the hand over the lower half of the sternum. The other hand is placed over the hand on the sternum with the fingers either interlaced or extended and the elbow extended so that the weight of the upper body is used for compression.\n\nIn infants, if there is a single rescuer, compressions are effected by placing 2 fingers in the center of the chest, just below the nipple line. If there are 2 or more rescuers, then 2 thumb technique is used.\nIn infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest, which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants.\nFor pediatric patients, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. In adults, the ratio is 30:2 irrespective of the number of rescuers.\n\n\n",
