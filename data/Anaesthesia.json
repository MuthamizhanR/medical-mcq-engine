These devices are placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air is loaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient\u2019s airway.\nSome humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission of microbes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients.\nThe disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit.\nShown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material.\nShown above is the placement of HME filter in the breathing circuit.",

    "explanation": "\nThe patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment of choice is IV Ibutilide.\nIbutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinus rhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period.\nIt is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can be administered 10 minutes after the first.\nIf there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment of choice.\nCardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronized with the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration of shock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized.\nHowever, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travel from the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium at once to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made to interrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node can take back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity.\nCardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent such as midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse is imminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should be preferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedative agents.\nEnergy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic or biphasic.\nMonophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasic defibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electrically opposite direction for the second half.\nBiphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistent magnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies than monophasic waveform defibrillators.\nEnergy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energy requirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010.\nAtrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows:\n200 Joules for monophasic devices\n120-200 Joules for biphasic devices\nAtrial flutter energy requirements are as follows:\n100 Joules for monophasic devices\n50-100 Joules for biphasic devices\nVentricular tachycardia with pulse energy requirements are as follows:\n200 Joules for monophasic devices\n100 Joules for biphasic devices\nVentricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia energy requirements are as follows:\n360 Joules for monomorphic devices\n120-200 Joules for biphasic devices",

Thus it doesn\u2019t have much of a survival benefit.\nEpinephrine and amiodarone are the two main drugs approved by the AHA for resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest.\nThe first dose of epinephrine,1 mg IV, is administered after the 2nd defibrillator shock is delivered and it is continued every 3-5 minutes.\nIf this is not effective, 300 mg IV bolus dose of amiodarone can be given and another dose of 150 mg given if necessary",

Accidental early deflation of the tourniquet can lead to massive systemic doses of bupivacaine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and\ncardiovascular collapse.\nIVRA or Bier\u2019s block involves the intravenous administration of LA into a tourniquet-occluded limb for short surgical procedures (&lt;45-60 minutes) on the limbs. Drugs used are\nlidocaine (most common), prilocaine, mepivacaine, chloroprocaine, procaine, and etidocaine.\nThe image below shows Bier's block of the upper limb. A double pneumatic tourniquet is inflated to 50-100mmHg above systolic BP after exsanguination of the limb with Esmarch bandage.\n30-40ml of 0.5% Lidocaine is injected which provides anesthesia for 30-45 minutes. Even for a very short duration procedure, the tourniquet must be left inflated for at least 15\u201320 min to avoid a rapid systemic absorption of LA resulting in toxicity. Slow deflation is recommended to avoid LA toxicity.",

Although this may affect relative baricity of local anaesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimportant. Hence, this is the best answer to choose from the above options.\nOption A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anaesthetic.\nOption C: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors.\nOption D: Within the range of \u201cnormal-sized\u201d adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anaesthesia.

While a hypobaric solution moves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection.\nWith the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric solution moves caudally.\nIn clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia.

    ],
    "correct_option": "b",
    "explanation": "\nThe correct statement regarding venous air embolism (VAE) is, a decrease in oxygen saturation will not always be seen, even with larger emboli.\nVAE can occur when the pressure within an open vein is subatmospheric. It can occur in any position or procedure, whenever the wound is above the level of the heart. The incidence of venous air embolism is greater during sitting craniotomies than in craniotomies in any other position.\nOption A: Physiological monitors (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide) have poor sensitivity and specificity and the clinical signs are manifested\nlate. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most sensitive method to monitor and can detect up to 0.02ml/kg of air embolism.\nOption C: Patients with a right to left shunt are susceptible to paradoxical air emboli which can result in a stroke or coronary occlusion.\nOption D: The surgeon should be notified immediately so that he or she can flood the surgical field with saline or pack it with wet gauzes and apply bone wax to the skull edges until the entry site is identified and occluded.",

It is usually administered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents.\nOther sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, temazepam and ketamine.\nOption A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability of short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation in children with pain.\nOption B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that would prolong its action in young children.\nOption D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in pediatric patients.\nNote- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause hallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is administered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam).",
