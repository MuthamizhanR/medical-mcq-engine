Hence he is exempted.\nCase 4: The delusion is judged as if it is real. The accused thought he was doing his job legally as the state executioner. Hence he is exempted.\nCase 5: Epilepsy, schizophrenia, and paranoia are exempted in the court of law from criminal liability. In this case, the patient was probably in post-ictal state, and mens rea was absent.\nThus, in cases 3, 4, and 5, the accused are medically insane and legally insane.\nCase 1: The accused killed his children out of severe disturbance. However, as per the law, the disturbance is not considered to impair his thinking capacity. There was also no need for\nself-defense. Hence he would not be exempted.\nCase 2: The delusion is judged as if it is unreal (i.e., there is no delusion), because the patient was deluded that the victim had killed his wife, but the motive to attempt the murder was out of revenge which is illegal and hence, the person is not exempted.\nThus, in cases 1 and 2, the people are medically insane, but not legally insane."

It can be precipitated by anxiety, stress, and oromandibular dystonia.\nSleep-related bruxism is commonly seen in the 1st or 2nd decade of life and can persist lifelong. It can be prominently noted in mainly N1 and N2 NREM sleep and sometimes in REM sleep.\nIt may be associated with conditions such as:\nHuntington\u2019s diseas\nCerebral palsy\nMental retardation.\nBruxism can be precipitated by anxiety and stress. It can lead to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. Local injections of botulinum toxins (botox) into the masseter muscles can help in the prevention of dental and TMJ problems.\nBruxism can be seen secondary to the usage of entactogen drugs (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine \u2013 MDMA), amphetamine, cocaine, alcohol, and some serotonin reuptake inhibitors."

    "explanation": "\nThe history is suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the first-line choice of treatment for this condition.\nGabapentinoids are considered superior to dopamine agonists due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse\ncontrol disorders.\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while trying to fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night and moving legs or walking reduces discomfort. Uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency and folic acid\u2013deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS.\nIn patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).\nFDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:\nGabapentin\nRopinirol\nPramipexol\nRotigotin\nNote: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder."

It is explicitly mentioned in the question that the patient always remains unemployed during the winter months which acts as the objective psychological stressor in this case.\nMajor depressive disorder with seasonal pattern refers to the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at specific times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in the fall or winter and remit in spring. Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes during this period.\nDysthymia (option C) is the presence of a persistently depressed mood that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for at least 2 years. Dysthymia will also never present with an episode of mania/hypomania.\nCyclothymia (option D) is a mild form of bipolar II disorder, characterized by symptoms\nof hypomania and mild depression. Hypomania mainly includes symptoms like persistently elevated or irritable mood and abnormally increased energy lasting for at least 4 consecutive days. The depression seen in cyclothymia does not qualify the criteria for a major depressive episode."
