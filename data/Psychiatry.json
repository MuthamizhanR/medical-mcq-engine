This temporal gradation of retrograde amnesia that preferentially spares the more distant memories is known as Ribot's law.\nE.g: If an incident causing retrograde amnesia occurs at 30 years of age, the memories acquired at 25 years of age may be more severely affected than those memories acquired at 20 years of age or earlier.\n\n\n",

Recently he moved to his son\u2019s flat in Delhi but forgets this, and continues to get ready after breakfast to go and water his garden. Neuropsychiatric evaluation is normal except for some mild cognitive impairment. What is this phenomenon called?\nRetroactive interference\nProactive interference\nOutput interference\nBiological Amnesia\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given clinical scenario in which information stored earlier interferes with the retrieval of new information is called proactive interference.\nOption A: Retroactive Interference - new information interferes with the retrieval of information stored earlier.\nOption C: Output interference - the initial act of recalling particular information interferes with the retrieval of the original information. For example, When trying to remember a limited number of items, such as a list of words or the names of individuals in a group, recalling some items can make it more difficult to recall other items in the same collection.\nOption D: Biological Amnesia - amnesia due to brain damage.\n\n\n\nThe given history of fall and anterograde amnesia points towards the diagnosis of concussion.\nA concussion is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. It can result from vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries, etc. Anterograde amnesia/post-traumatic amnesia is the hallmark of a concussion. In this type of amnesia, the events following the injury cannot be recalled.\nOther clinical features of concussion include headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Option A: Drunkenness - the patient will be drowsy or sleepy and not awake.\nOption B: Diffuse axonal injury - seen in high-speed deceleration which causes disruption and shearing of axons leading to microhemorrhages. Usually results in a persistent vegetative stage.\nOption D: Cerebral venous thrombosis - acute thrombosis in dural venous sinuses; manifests as headache, visual abnormalities, or seizures.\n\nDepressive Disorders\n\n",

It is explicitly mentioned in the question that the patient always remains unemployed during the winter months which acts as the objective psychological stressor in this case.\nMajor depressive disorder with seasonal pattern refers to the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at specific times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in the fall or winter and remit in spring. Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by prominent energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes during this period.\nDysthymia (option C) is the presence of a persistently depressed mood that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for at least 2 years. Dysthymia will also never present with an episode of mania/hypomania.\nCyclothymia (option D) is a mild form of bipolar II disorder, characterized by symptoms\nof hypomania and mild depression. Hypomania mainly includes symptoms like persistently elevated or irritable mood and abnormally increased energy lasting for at least 4 consecutive days. The depression seen in cyclothymia does not qualify the criteria for a major depressive episode.\n\n\n",

The theory connects depressive phenomena to the experience of uncontrollable events. It was proposed by Martin Seligman.\nAnother good example of this can be a situation of domestic abuse where women tend to leave several times before doing so for good. A person may believe that they can never escape the abuser, even when help and support are available.\nOption B: The theory of psychosocial development was proposed by Erik Erikson. There are 8 stages of psychosocial development. He states that there are critical time periods, each of which poses a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual. The resolution of this conflict results in either psychosocial growth or regression.\nOption C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction between the conscious and unconscious forces of Id, ego, and super-ego.\nOption D: Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.\n\n\n",

The patient says his mood has been stable with his current regimen, but for the past three months, he has had tremors primarily affecting his hands. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?\nCarbamazepine\nGabapentin\nLamotrigine\nLithium carbonate\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nLithium carbonate is most likely to cause the tremors described in the given scenario.\nTremors are a common adverse effect of lithium carbonate. They are sometimes related to peak serum lithium levels.\nDividing the dose of lithium carbonate and decreasing caffeine intake can decrease the severity of the tremors. In case of severe coarse tremors, lithium carbonate toxicity (serum lithium level greater than 2.5 mEq/L) must be ruled out.\nOptions A and C: Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are off-label agents used for the management of bipolar disorder, however, they do not cause tremors.\nOption B: Tremors may occur as an adverse effect of gabapentin, but it is not prescribed for the management of bipolar disorder.\n\n\n",

Sodium valproate is the drug of choice for this disorder.\nDiagnosis of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder:\n4 or more mood disturbances in a year\n\nEpisodes either have a partial or full remission for at least 2 months or switch to the opposite polarity\nOther options:\nOption A: Lamotrigine has been found to have limited uses in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. It can prolong the time between depression and mania.\nOption C: Carbamazepine takes 2-3 weeks for the onset of action and is used in patients not responding to Lithium in Acute Mania.\nOption D: Lithium takes 5-7 days to achieve a level of equilibrium, moreover it is effective in Bipolar I disorder and is less efficacious than Divalproex in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nThe given clinical features are seen in Ebstein's anomaly. This is a rare congenital cyanotic heart disease caused by the downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is a teratogenic effect of lithium, a drug used for prophylaxis in manic disorder.\nLithium is thus avoided in the first trimester and during lactation. An antipsychotic like olanzapine should be considered instead of prophylactic management.\nIf lithium is to be continued, then:\nThe dose should be tapered to the lower end of the therapeutic range\nIt should be given in divided dose\nThe levels should be checked every two week\nThe woman should be hydrated well throughout labour\nWithholding lithium therapy for 24-48 hours before delivery is recommended\n\nAlcohol-Related Disorders\n\n",

Antipsychotic medications may reduce the seizure threshold in these patients and should be avoided.\nThe best treatment for delirium tremens is prevention. Patients withdrawing from alcohol who exhibit withdrawal phenomena should receive benzodiazepines, such as 25 to 50 mg of chlordiazepoxide every 2 to 4 hours until they seem to be out of danger.\nOnce the delirium appears, 50 to 100 mg of chlordiazepoxide should be given every 4 hours orally, or lorazepam should be given intravenously (IV) if oral medication is not possible.\nA high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet supplemented by multivitamins is also important. Carbohydrates increase the serotonin levels similar to alcohol, lowering the rates of withdrawal seizures.\n\n\n",

Which of the following statements is true regarding the given condition?\nPatients usually have ophthalmoplegia.\nMedial thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies are involved.\nMRI shows 'sandwich' sign.\nIt is a complication of acute alcohol intoxication.\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\n\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of Marchiafava Bignami disease (MBD). It is characteristically associated with a 'sandwich' sign on MRI.\nMBD is a rare, idiopathic CNS disorder seen as a complication of chronic alcoholism. Early symptoms may include depression, paranoia, psychosis, or dementia. Seizures, hemiparesis, aphasia, and abnormal movements, and ataxia are also seen. If not promptly identified and treated may progress to coma and death.\nIt is associated with central degeneration of corpus callosum, sparing the dorsal and ventral parts. This characteristic pattern of degeneration presents as the 'sandwich' sign, best visualized on sagittal MRI of the brain.\nClinically, conditions such as Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, delirium tremens, or pontine demyelination may have similar presentations and their features may overlap. Hence neuroimaging plays a significant role in the accurate diagnosis of MB disease.\nOphthalmoplegia and involvement of mamillary bodies and medial thalamic nuclei are associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, not MBD.\nThe sagittal MRI image given below shows the characteristic 'sandwich' sign in Marchiafava Bignami disease.\n\n\n\n",

On examination, he appears inattentive, has bilateral horizontal nystagmus, and his gait is slow and wide-based. What is the next step in management?\nAdminister IV dextrose\nGive haloperidol injection\nGive thiamine injection\nCorrect electrolytes\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a medical emergency. Thiamine administration (100 mg IV or IM for 3 days followed by two to three times a day orally for 1 to 2 weeks) may reduce the risk of it progressing to chronic Korsakoff psychosis which is irreversible.\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is seen due to the deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine is a cofactor (TPP) in glucose metabolism. Thus, starting dextrose infusions before thiamine administration will exacerbate the existing thiamine deficiency, precipitating Wernicke\u2019s disease. Thiamine is also involved in the conduction of the axon potential and synaptic transmission.\n\nAlcohol abuse leads to thiamine deficiency by the following mechanisms:\nPoor nutritional habits\nFolate deficiency - reduces thiamine absorption from the gastrointestinal tract\nDirect damage of the intestinal mucosa\nWernicke's encephalopathy/alcoholic encephalopathy is an acute neurological disorder characterized by the clinical triad (GOA):\nGlobal Confusion\nOphthalmoplegia ( first symptom to improve with thiamine +dextrose infusion)\nAtaxia\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of confabulation. It is one of the features of Korsafkoff\u2019s psychosis. Confabulation is filling up gaps in memory with false stories.\nKorsakoff\u2019s psychosis is a chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency (secondary to alcoholism). The cardinal features are impaired mental syndrome and anterograde amnesia. Only 20% of patients recover with treatment (whereas in Wernicke's encephalopathy there is complete reversal with treatment).\nClinical features:\nImpaired mental syndrome - especially recent memory\nStriking inability to form new memories - severe anterograde amnesia\nRetrograde amnesia is less severe.\nPresent with confabulation as an attempt to cover the memory deficit\nThere is a lack of insight and no intellectual functional loss.\nOverall intact intelligence\nImplicit learning (e.g., learning procedures) is preserved.\nLong-term and immediate memory is normal.\nTreatment: Thiamine is given 100mg orally two to three times daily for 3 to 12 months.\n\nOther Substance Use Disorders\n\n",

It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence.\nOption B: Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-Q) was developed to assess the severity of alcohol dependence.\nOption C: The CAGE questionnaire is used to assess whether or not there is a problem with dependence.\nC - Have you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking?\nA - Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\nG - Have you ever felt guilty or bad about your drinking?\nE - Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?\nOne 'yes' response raises a suspicion of an alcohol use problem and more than one is a strong indication of abuse or dependence.\nOption D: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. The AUDIT also helps to identify alcohol dependence and some specific consequences of harmful drinking.\n\n\n",

However, the blood reports came back suggesting both of them having similarly elevated levels of alcohol. Which of the following is a possible explanation for this observation?\nMellanby effect\nIntermediate syndrome\nReverse tolerance\nGrand Rapids effect\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe given situation can be best explained by the Mellanby effect.\n\nThe Mellanby effect is the phenomenon where an individual\u2019s perceived level of impairment at identical blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels is greater when the BAC is rising (while drinking) than when it is falling (after drinking).\nThe clip below describes the Mellanby effect seen originally in a dog experiment.\n\n\nOption B: Intermediate syndrome is a delayed-onset of muscular weakness and paralysis following an episode of organophosphate (acute cholinesterase inhibitor) poisoning.\nOption C: Reverse tolerance refers to the phenomenon when an individual requires a lesser dose of alcohol (drug) to obtain the same effect as before.\nOption D: Grand Rapids effect or dip is a controversial effect noted in certain studies where a BAC of 0.01\u20130.04% slightly lowered the risk of being in a vehicle accident when compared to a BAC of 0.00%\n\n\n",

Of late, he has noticed that he is able to obtain the same effect with just a quarter bottle. What is this phenomenon called?\nTachyphylaxis\nDesensitization\nReverse tolerance\nCross tolerance\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nWhen an individual requires a lesser dose of alcohol (drug) to obtain the same effect as before, this phenomenon is known as reverse tolerance.\nIn alcoholics, it is a sign of late-stage alcoholism, where the patient has developed cirrhosis. The liver doesn\u2019t produce enough enzymes like before to metabolize alcohol leading to increased blood alcohol levels.\nOption A: Tachyphylaxis is the rapid development of tolerance when a drug is repeatedly used in quick succession, resulting in a marked reduction in response.\nOption B: Desensitization may be equivalent to drug tolerance and refers to a diminished response/effect with continued use of the same dose of the substance.\nOption D: Cross-tolerance is a phenomenon that occurs when tolerance to the effects of one drug produces tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similar pharmacological actions. eg. alcohol and benzodiazepines (both are depressants).\n\nNote: A quarter bottle is approximately 180 ml.\n\n\n",

It is an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor.\nAcetaldehyde is the first breakdown product of alcohol, which is further metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase. If a patient who is on disulfiram consumes alcohol, it results in toxic levels of acetaldehyde.\nThis causes symptoms such as flushing, pulsating headache, nausea, vomiting, respiratory difficulties, chest pain, and autonomic manifestations, collectively termed as disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER).\nOther deterrent agents include citrated calcium carbamide and metronidazole. Anti-craving drugs used in alcohol deaddiction include:\nBaclofen\nAcamprosate\nNaltrexone\nNewer drugs are topiramate, SSRI and ondansetron Alcohol deaddiction treatment involves the following phases:\nIntervention - aimed at maximizing the motivation for treatment and continued abstinence.\nDetoxification - involves minimizing withdrawal symptoms.\nRehabilitation and maintenance - includes three major components:\nContinued efforts to increase and maintain high levels of motivation for abstinence\nWork to help the patient readjust to a lifestyle free of alcoho\nRelapse prevention\n\n\n",

What is the diagnosis?\nDepression\nIllness anxiety disorder\nSomatoform disorder\nGeneralised anxiety disorder\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of generalised anxiety disorder.\nWhen assessing for GAD, clinical professionals look for the following according to the DSM-5 (and ICD-11) criteria:\nThe presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least six months and is clearly excessive.\nThe worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.\nThe anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one of these symptoms is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):\nEdginess or restlessness\nTiring easily; more fatigued than usua\nImpaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank\nIrritability (which may or may not be observable to others)\nIncreased muscle aches or soreness\nDifficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)\n\n\n",

Which of the following best explains his condition?\nSocial anxiety disorder\nAutism\nSelective mutism\nADHD\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nSelective mutism is a disorder of children wherein they are unable to speak in certain social situations.\nSuch children are capable of speaking normally when at home. The disorder can also be evident during interactions between the child and less-familiar adults. For diagnosis, the mutism must impact social or educational functioning for greater than one month.\nCBT + SSRI is the preferred treatment modality.\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of panic disorder where misappraisals of body sensations trigger emotional and physiological reactions of fear and heightened arousal. Interoceptive exposure is the practice of strategically inducing the somatic symptoms associated with a threat appraisal, and encouraging the patient to maintain contact with the feared sensations.\nInteroceptive exposure is a form of exposure therapy for the treatment of panic disorder and specific phobias. It is done using an activity that produces similar physiological sensations to the ones that are produced during the panic attack. The purpose is to promote the habituation of fear in response to them.\nExample: Aerobic exercise to induce rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Breathing through thin straw produces a sensation of not getting enough air.\nOption B: Imaginal exposure typically involves having the patient close their eyes and imagine feared stimuli.\nOption C: In vivo exposure involves helping patients directly confront feared objects, activities, and situations.\nOption D: Flooding approach involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity without relaxation.\n\nObsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\n",

It consists of a fear that the penis is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen. The fear is related to labia, nipples, or breasts in females. It is classified under \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" in DSM-5. Females are also affected infrequently, with a corresponding belief that their breasts (and/or vulva) are shrinking.\nOption A: Dhat syndrome is a cultural condition found in the Indian subcontinent. Male patients complain of premature ejaculation or impotence and believe that they are passing semen in their urine. In their tradition, semen is described as a \"vital fluid\". The discharge of this \"vital fluid\" through sex or masturbation is associated with anxiety and dysphoria. It is characterized by the complaint of the passage of dhat (whitish discharge: semen) in urine, multiple somatic symptoms, physical/mental exhaustion, and sexual dysfunction. It is based on the belief that semen\nis precious and that loss of semen leads to exhaustion and weakness.\nOption C: Shubo-kyofu is similar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity.\nOption D: Latah (startle reaction) is a syndrome seen in Southeast Asia and Japan. Occurring more often in women, it is typically characterized by the presence of automatic obedience, echolalia (mimicking another's speech), and echopraxia (mimicking another's movement). It is often precipitated by a sudden stimulus, such as a loud sound.\nAnother culture-bound syndrome:\nShenkui is native to China, and also exists globally, in which the individual suffers withdrawal-like symptoms including painful brain fog, chills, nausea, and even flu-like symptoms with anxiety, believed to be caused by a loss of semen and orgasm. The symptoms can last for weeks to months after a single orgasm.\n\nTrauma and Stress-Related Disorders\n\n",

Hence, despite\n\nthe patient perceiving a loss of control over the voluntary act (compulsion), they still retain personal possession (ownership) of the act.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder is defined as the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions.\nObsessions are recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted and cause anxiety or distress to the patients.\nCompulsions are the repetitive and intentional behaviors or acts performed in response to obsessions or according to certain rules that must be applied rigidly (e.g., repetitive hand washing, ritualistic checking).\nIn the given case, the obsessional thoughts are the repetitive, unwanted thoughts that his hands are dirty, while the compulsion is to wash his hands to neutralize the obsession.\n\n\n\n",

Stressors may be single like loss of job or divorce; multiple like the death of a parent together with loss of a job; or recurrent like seasonal business difficulties.\nDiagnosing criteria for adjustment disorder:\nDevelopment of emotional or behavioural response within 3 months of the onset of the stressor.\nThe symptoms or behaviour are clinically significant, where, any one of the following are met:\nThe response is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor.\nSignificant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.\nThe stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder or exacerbation of pre-existing mental disorder.\n\nMostly depressive but can also have anxiety symptoms.\nThe symptoms disappear within 6 months if the stressor is removed.\nIn the given case, it has been mentioned that the patient lost his job recently. Although a time period is not mentioned in the question, the term recently can be understood as well within the 3 months duration. The patient's behaviour such as sad and irritated affected his social functioning. As he was finding joy in watching movies, depression can be ruled out.\n\n\n",

In this stage, the child must learn to trust others during the first year of life (the sense of trust vs mistrust) or they will have trouble forming close relationships as adults.\nPsychosocial development: According to the psychosocial stages of development by Erik Erikson, there are critical time periods, each of which poses a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual.

They understand logical reasoning, scientific facts, and other matters that are typically taught in school. Children also become more competitive, they want to do things that other children of the same age can do.\nWhen they make the effort to perform a task and succeed, they develop self-confidence.

The stages are:\nSensorimotor stage (birth\u20132 years):\nStarts with an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type of thinking\nEnds with object permanence (knowing an object exists even though it cannot be seen)\nSymbolisation- developing mental symbols and words for the objects\nPre-operational stage (2-7 years):\nThinking without reasoning- intuitive thinking\nOnly concerned about their own needs and perspective- egocentric thinking\nOther thinking processes are seen- animism, primitive thinking, centration, magical or fantasy thinking\nConcrete operational stage (7-11 years):\nStart to see things from other's perspectives\nThinking is concrete and litera\nDevelop conservation- understanding that despite changes in shape, the object remains the same. For eg: when water is transferred from a cup to glass, they understand that it is water only and that the volume is the same\nDevelop the concept of reversibility- knowing that one thing can turn into another and turn back. Eg., water and ice\nOther processes- classification, transitivity\nFormal operational stage (&gt;11 years):\nDevelop abstract thinking, wherein they can generalize or conceptualize\nCan make a hypothesis and use deductive reasoning\nHypotheticodeductive thinking- the highest organization of cognition, enables persons to make a hypothesis or proposition and to test it against reality\n\n\n",

E.g., water and ice.\n\nOption C: Transitivity: The ability to recognize relationships among various things in a serial order. E.g., when told to put away his books according to height, the child identifies and starts with placing the tallest one on one end of the bookshelf and the shortest one ends up at the other end.\nOption D: Conservation: Understanding that despite changes in shape, the object remains the same.

It acts to perfect and civilize our behaviour. The voice of conscience comes from the superego. It is mostly unconscious but also has a conscious component.\nSigmund Freud's structural theory of mind divides mental apparatus into the following:\nId (new-born) is a reservoir for basic survival instincts, aggression, and survival drives. It is based on the pleasure principle (immediate gratification). It is entirely unconscious.\nEgo (reality principle) is the executive part of the mind that maintains the balance between id and superego. It is based on exposure to reality and utilizes influences from the external world to modify the id. It is conscious except for unconscious defense mechanisms.\nSuperego (idealism principle) establishes and maintains a moral conscience in an individual by constantly comparing a person\u2019s thoughts and feelings to expected standards of behavior.\nE.g., While studying, our id wants us to watch a movie instead and our superego wants us to study very hard without taking many breaks. Our ego thus balances between the two and we decide that we will study for few hours and then take a break to watch a movie.\n\n\n",

They internalize the character of the aggressor as one's own character. As they do so, they may even develop fear towards the police who come to rescue them and even try to escape from the police, and co-operate with the kidnapper's actions.\n",

This barrier separates the contents of the unconscious and the conscious mind.\nSigmund Freud's topographic theory of mind divides the mind into 3 levels:\nUnconscious- contains instinctual drives, repressed memories, and thought processes. It is characterized by illogical and primitive thoughts called primary process thinking. It focuses on immediate wish fulfillment and instinctual discharge.\nPreconscious- composed of mental events, processes, and contents that can be brought into conscious awareness by the act of focusing attention. It contains a barrier called repression. Eg: Although most persons are not consciously aware of the appearance of their first-grade teacher, they ordinarily can bring this image to mind by deliberately focusing attention on the memory.\nConscious- part of the mind which is accessible to us. Everything we know about ourselves is in the conscious part of our mind. Perceptions coming from the outside world or from within the\n\nbody or mind are brought into awareness in this part.\nNote: The unconscious is the part of the mind that contains repressed thoughts and memories whereas the barrier that censors these (repression) exists in the preconscious part of the mind.\n\n\n",

Raw: Question 4:\n\nWhich of the following is false according to the topographical theory?\nPrimary process thinking is illogical and primitive\nAn unconscious thought can never reach conscious awareness\nThe drives and desires that one is born with are part of the unconscious mind\nThe contents of the preconscious mind can be brought into awareness by focussing\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 4:\nAccording to Sigmund Freud's topographical theory, an unconscious memory or thought can reach consciousness by overcoming the barrier of repression.\nThis barrier can be overcome in two ways:\nDuring sleep- the repression force is lax, and thus many unconscious desires and thoughts reach our consciousness through dreams. So, he believed that the interpretation of dreams can revea the contents of the unconscious mind.\nFree association- when a person is relaxed enough to say whatever comes to their minds without censoring thoughts, a few unconscious thoughts may come out by a slip of the tongue.\nNote: In psychotherapy, there is a process called abreaction by which repressed material, particularly a painful experience or conflict, is brought back to consciousness by hypnosis or free association. In this process, the person not only recalls but also relives the repressed material causing an emotional release.\n\n\n",

It is a specific type of catharsis done by becoming conscious of repressed traumatic events.\nCatharsis is a general term for the process of releasing strong or repressed emotions. It can be done through various mediums, like expressing emotions through art. When the unconscious repressed memories are consciously recalled and relived, this technique specifically is called abreaction.\n\n\n",

It is the barrier due to which the thoughts and events stored in our unconscious mind do not come out to our conscious mind and awareness.\nAccording to the 'Interpretation of dreams' written by Sigmund Freud, dreams represent unconscious wishes or thoughts which are not accepted by the conscious mind. They manifest through the following mechanisms:\nSymbolism: Representation of highly charged ideas or objects through innocent images that are in some way connected.\n\nDisplacement: Transfer of mental energy from one object to a substitute or symbolic representation of the object.\nCondensation: Mechanism by which multiple unconscious wishes combine into a single image or when one unconscious wish gets distributed into multiple images.\nProjection: Attributing one\u2019s own unacknowledged feelings to others.\nSecondary elaboration: Process by which the ego organizes illogical, bizarre and absurd images into a more coherent form in dreams.\n\n\n",

However, factitious disorder has only one motive - seeking and attaining medical attention.\nMalingering is suspected when there is:\nMedicolegal context of presentation\nDiscrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or disability and the objective findings\nLack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the prescribed treatment regimen\nPresence of antisocial personality disorder Malingering can be for the following reasons:\nAvoidance of criminal responsibility\n\nAvoidance of military service or of particularly hazardous duties\nFinancial gain\nAvoidance of work, social responsibility, and social consequences.\nFacilitation of transfer from prison to hospita\nAdmission to a hospital (for getting a place to stay)\nThe discrepancy between symptoms and examination findings, and conscious production of symptoms can be present in both disorders.

Which of the following best describes her perception?\nDerealization\nDissociative fugue\nDissociative amnesia\nDepersonalization\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe given scenario is suggestive of depersonalization. It is defined as the persistent or recurrent feeling of detachment or estrangement from one's self.\nThe individual may report feeling like watching himself or herself in a movie or feeling like an automaton. Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and physical numbing).\nDerealization refers to feelings of unreality or of being detached from one's environment. The patient may describe his or her perception of the outside world as lacking lucidity and emotional coloring, as though dreaming or dead.\n\n\n",

Which of the following CSF findings would be diagnostic for her condition?\nDecreased hypocretin levels\nDecreased GABA levels\nIncreased hypocretin levels\nIncreased GABA levels\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe patient experienced an episode of cataplexy, which is characterized by decreased levels of hypocretin in CSF. cataplexy is sudden loss of muscle tone, such as jaw or head drop, weakness of\n\nthe knees, or paralysis of all skeletal muscles with collapse. It is seen in narcolepsy.\nNarcolepsy is the classical example of sleepiness caused due to CNS dysfunction of sleep mechanisms, mainly, a genetically triggered hypocretin deficit and dysfunction.\nLevels of hypocretin receptor-I are undetectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals who are HLA DQB 1*0602-positive (consistent with cataplexy-associated narcolepsy).\nThe classic form of narcolepsy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) is characterized by a tetrad of symptoms:\nExcessive daytime sleepiness\nCataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone)\nHypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations\nSleep paralysis\nSymptoms commonly appear in the second decade of life. Strong emotions (such as laughter and anger) usually act as the trigger for cataplexy.\nPharmacotherapy remains the treatment of choice. Modafinil, an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist, is used to reduce the number of sleep attacks and to improve psychomotor performance in narcolepsy. Besides this, imipramine and fluoxetine are also found effective in eliminating cataplexy.\n\n\n",

Which of the following drugs is used in treating the condition?\nGabapentin\nPramipexol\nVitamin B12\nIron tablets\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe history is suggestive of restless leg syndrome and gabapentin is the first-line choice of treatment for this condition.\nGabapentinoids are considered superior to dopamine agonists due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse\n\ncontrol disorders.\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while trying to fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night and moving legs or walking reduces discomfort. Uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency and folic acid\u2013deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS.\nIn patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).\nFDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome:\nGabapentin\nRopinirol\nPramipexol\nRotigotin\nNote: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder.\n\n\n",

It provides a visual representation of sleep structure and is useful in the diagnosis of various sleep disorders.\nAn electroencephalogram is the depiction of the electrical activity of the surface of the brain. Different waveforms (alpha, beta, theta, delta) are produced depending on the functional status of the brain.\n\n\nPolysomnography is a multi parametric test that is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. It is a continuous recording of biophysiological changes that occur during sleep. It includes,\nContinuous EEG recording, from occipital and parietal leads\nElectro-oculography- to record eye movements\nElectromyography- for muscle potential and its activities\nECG\nMultiple sleep latency tests- repeated measures of time taken to sleep\nNasal-oral airflow, respiratory effort, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and leg movements during sleep are measured.\n\n\nEpworth sleep assessment scale is a questionnaire used to quantify daytime sleepiness.

Which of the following conditions is associated with such a presentation?\nBinge eating disorder\nBulimia nervosa\nRumination disorder\nAnorexia nervosa\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 12:\nRepeated regurgitation of food is associated with rumination disorder.\nRumination disorder is typically is seen in infants but is also seen in adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities. It is characterized by repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Partially digested food is brought back up to the mouth without nausea or retching. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.\nCongenital anomalies, infections, and other medical illnesses should be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of rumination disorder.\nThe condition has high rates of spontaneous remission and can be managed with behavioural therapy.\n\n\n\nThe SCOFF (Sick, Control, One, Fat, Food) questionnaire is a screening tool for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.\nIt consists of 5 questions with 1 point being awarded for every positive reply. The SCOFF questions:\nDo you make yourself Sick because you feel uncomfortably full?\nDo you worry that you have lost Control over how much you eat?\nHave you recently lost more than One stone (~6.35 kg) in a 3-month period?\nDo you believe yourself to be Fat when others say you are too thin?\nWould you say that Food dominates your life?\nA score greater than 2 indicates likely anorexia or bulimia.

One discrete episode does not justify the diagnosis.\nA minimum age of \u00e8 years is re\u017duired to diagnose this condition and it is more commonly seen in men than women. These episodes can result in serious assault or the destruction of property. The aggressiveness expressed is grossly out of proportion to any stressors that may have helped elicit the episodes.\nAfter each episode, patients usually show genuine regret or self-reproach. Signs of generalized impulsivity or aggressiveness are absent between episodes.\n\n\n\nSerotonin is believed to be the neurotransmitter that plays a major role in intermittent explosive disorder.\nSerotonergic neurons mediate behavioral inhibition. The restoration of serotonin activity, by administering serotonin precursors such as L-tryptophan or drugs that increase synaptic serotonin levels, restores the behavioral effect of punishment and controls episodic violent tendencies.\n\u00eaote: Low CS\u2018 5-HIAA (hydroxy-indoleacetic acid) levels have been correlated with impulsive aggression.\n\nPsychiatric Emergencies\n\n",

What would be the appropriate management?\n\n\n\n1 and 4\n2, 4 and 5\n2 and 3\n1, 3 and 5\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe given clinical scenario of high-grade fever and pharyngitis and the simultaneous development of oral ulcers (image) in a patient on clozapine is suggestive of drug-induced agranulocytosis. The treatment is to stop clozapine immediately, administer granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\n(G-CSF), and start empirical antibiotics.\nAgranulocytosis is a rare, but fatal complication of clozapine. It is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500/mm3, or white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 2000/mm3. It can initially manifest as a local infection with high-grade fever, sore throat, oral and perianal ulcerations.\nThese symptoms appear rapidly within days to weeks following initiation of drug therapy.\nClozapine is generally considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs and is often used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychotic drugs). Hence, a switch from clozapine to another (less effective) antipsychotic drug is not done in a patient with drug-induced agranulocytosis.\n",

On examination, his BP was 190/120. What is false about his present condition?\nThe condition is less common with selegilline.\nShould be treated with phentolamine.\nHe is suffering from serotonin syndrome.\nTyramine is involved the pathogenesis of the condition.\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 3:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of cheese reaction, not serotonin syndrome. Here, the patient on phenelzine (non-selective and irreversible MAO-inhibitor) developed the clinical features of cheese reaction on having a tyramine-rich food item (red wine, cheese, milk).\nInhibition of the MAO-A isoform prevents the metabolism of dietary tyramine in the gut, thus allowing intact tyramine to enter the systemic circulation. It is taken up by adrenergic neurons and a hypertensive crisis occurs as a result of a powerful pressor effect of tyramine.\nThe drug of choice to treat hypertensive crisis in cheese reaction is phentolamine.\n\n\n\nMAO-inhibitor with SSRI causes serotonin syndrome. Symptoms are fever, altered mental status, rigidity, hyperreflexia, and autonomic dysfunction.\nSelegiline and rasagiline do not functionally inhibit MAO-A.

A common reason for this disorder is performance anxiety leading to sympathetic arousal.\nSuch men persistently or recurrently achieve orgasm and ejaculation before they wish to. Can be classified as:\nManagement:\nPharmacological: SSRI- Paroxetine and Dapoxetine (cause delayed ejaculation)\nNon-pharmacological: using techniques such as Squeeze technique, Start-stop technique and sensate focusing\n\nNote: DSM-5 refers only to vaginal penetration in its diagnostic criteria, whereas ICD-11 includes other relevant sexual stimulation also.\n\nMild\n30 sec to 1 min\nMode rate\n15 sec to 30 se c\nSever e\n<15 sec\n\n\n\nSeman's stop-start technique is used for premature ejaculation, to prolong the time period until ejaculation.\nSeman's technique (stop-start technique): A man approaches the point close to climax and then stops and relaxes before starting again. This method prolongs the time before ejaculation by relying on behaviour modification.\nOther treatments for premature ejaculation:\nSqueeze technique (by Master and Johnson's)- as a man approaches a climax, he squeezes the tip of the penis just below the head of the penis. The pressure is held there until the sensation of impending orgasm diminishes. The process can then be started over again so that over time a man prolongs the time period until he reaches ejaculation.\nSensate focusing - refocussing on the non-coital aspects of sexual activity.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - delays ejaculation. e.g.- dapoxetine, paroxetine.\n\nSexual Disorders and Sexual Abuse\n\n",

The given sexual disorders correspond to:\nA patient with sexual aversion - desire\nA patient having post-coital headache - resolution\nA patient with erectile dysfunction - excitement\nA patient with complaints of premature ejaculation - orgasm\nHence, the correct sequence of the given disorders according to the normal sexual response cycle is 1 - 3 - 4 - 2.\nSexual response is a true psycho-physiological experience. Normally, men and women experience a sequence of physiological responses to sexual stimulation.\nDesire phase - consists of sex fantasies and the desire to have sex.\nExcitement/Arousal phase - heightened excitement before orgasm (longest phase)\nOrgasmic phase - a subjective perception of a peak physical reaction and release occurs, along with a feeling of well-being (shortest phase)\nResolution phase - return to the baseline\nFollowing orgasm, men experience a refractory period during which they cannot be restimulated to further arousal. Women do not have a refractory period and can experience multiple, successive orgasms.\n\n\n",

Features usually start before 3 years of age and is more common in boys. Autism is characterized by the 2 core features of autism spectrum disorder: deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.\nIn addition, autism is also usually marked by language impairment, which occurs early in the developmental period. However this is not a core feature.\nBelow-normal intelligence is seen in about 30% of children with autistic disorder. However, some autistic children have unusual abilities in some areas (e.g., exceptional memory or calculation skills). These are referred to as savant skills.\n\n\n",

What aspect of her thinking is demonstrated?\nAbstract thinking\nContent of thought\nForm of thought\nConcrete thinking\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 13:\nWhen the person was asked the meaning of the proverb, they could only interpret it in the literal sense, and not think what the proverb actually means metaphorically. This is called concrete thinking.\nA person capable of abstract thinking would have answered the metaphorical meaning of the proverb given in the question (strike when the iron is hot), which is to take action when the opportunities are favourable.\nAbstract thinking is tested by asking the patient the meaning of a proverb or the similarities between objects like a table and a chair, or between a dog and a lion. Their responses are then judged based on whether they could think about the situation in different aspects, figuratively and metaphorically.\n\nConcrete thinking\nAbstract thinking\nDevelops first in childhood\nDevelops later in childhood g radually and emerges in adol escence\nUnderstand theliteralmeanin g of a sentence/proverb\nUnderstand thedeeper meani ngof a sentence/ proverb\nFocused on facts\nFocused on concepts\n\n\nConcrete thinking\tAbstract thinking\nConcrete thinking\tAbstract thinking\nCannot compare and contrast different objects/situations\nCan compare and contrast an d derive conclusions\nThink about a specific event/ object individually.\nCan derive generalizations fr om a specific event/object.\nThink about a situation in on e particular way\nThink about various aspects of a situation simultaneously\nCan think only about objects they have seen or situations t hey have experienced\nCan think about objects/situa tions that were never experie nced by them or that do not e xist in reality.\n\n\n\nThe method as shown demonstrates waxy flexibility, which is a feature of catatonia. In this, parts of the body can be placed in positions that will be maintained for long periods of time, even if very uncomfortable. The limbs are flexible like wax and a slight resistance is felt while moving them.\n\n\n\nFeatures of Catatonia:\nMutism- complete absence of speech.\nRigidity- maintenance of a rigid posture against efforts.\nNegativism- an apparently motiveless resistance to all commands.\nPosturing- voluntary assumption of an inappropriate and often bizarre posture for long periods of time, against gravity.\nWaxy flexibility- the patient's limbs can be manipulated to move in any position (flexible like wax), which is then retained by the patient for long periods of time, even if uncomfortable.\nStupor- akinesis (no movement) with mutism with relative preservation of conscious awareness.\n\nEcholalia- repetition of phrases or words heard.\nEchopraxia- repetition of actions observed.\nAmbitendency- tendency to act in opposing ways or directions because of conflicting impulses.\ne.g. on asking to take out the tongue, the tongue is slightly protruded but taken back again.\nGegenhalten- when subjects involuntary resist passive movements. The resistance is directly proportional to the force applied. Also called oppositional paratonia.\nMannerism- repetition of normal movements but inappropriately. They are purposeful. E.g., repeatedly saluting the people around.\nStereotypy- repetitive, odd, purposeless movements. E.g., making strange movements of fingers repeatedly.\nAutomatic obedience- commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature.\n\nAssessment in Psychiatry\n\n",

E.g., a patient may report that he hears voices criticizing him (auditory\nhallucination) every time he hears the sound of a rotating fan (auditory stimulus), which stops when the fan is not running.\nOption C: Panoramic hallucination is a compound hallucination in which the entire sensory input is replaced by hallucinatory perceptions, thus giving rise to a totally different perceptual reality.\nOption D: Pseudohallucination is a false perception heard within one's own mind (inner subjective space) rather than perceived as coming from the outside world (outer objective space), and is recognized as unreal.\nOther special types of hallucinations:\nHypnogogic hallucination- occurs prior to falling asleep (HypnoGogic: Going to sleep).\n\nHypnopompic hallucination- occurs prior to waking up.\nExtracampine hallucination- experienced outside the limits of one's sensory field. E.g., a patient in Delhi hearing voices from Chennai.\n\n\n",

A vast majority of cases persist into adult life. In the cases that remit at puberty or in early adulthood, overactivity is usually the first symptom to remit but the decreased attention span and impulse-control problems persist.\n\n\n\nA 13-year-old boy with a history of aggression towards people within the past 6 months, destruction of property, and theft for the last couple of years points towards a diagnosis\nof conduct disorder.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this child?\nTic disorder\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nCerebral palsy\nDevelopmental coordination disorder\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 1:\nBased on the clinical features mentioned above, the diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder.\nDevelopmental coordination disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which a child's fine and/or gross motor coordination is slower, less accurate, and more variable than in peers of the same age, which cannot be correlated with any specific neurological disorder or damage.\n\nDiagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is based on the following:\nA history of the child's delay in achieving early motor milestones.\nAssociation with below-normal scores on performance subtests of standardized intelligence tests and normal or above-normal scores on verbal subtests.\nThese children struggle to perform accurately the gross motor activities of daily life, such as jumping, hopping, running, or catching a ball. They also exhibit difficulty in fine motor skills like assembling jigsaw pieces, using scissors, drawing, or tracing. This results in poor performance in sports and even in academic achievement because of poor writing skills. Yet, they excel at verbal skills.\nThree general areas of deficits contribute to the disorder:\nPoor predictive control of motor movements\nDeficits in rhythmic coordination and timing\nDeficits in executive functions, including working memory, inhibition, and attention.\n\n\n",

Clozapine, contrary to many other atypical antipsychotics, has not been found to be useful in the treatment of tics (including Tourette's syndrome).\nTreatment modalities used for Tourette's syndrome (in order of preference):\nDetection and treatment of co-morbidities like OCD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety.\nEducation and behavioral treatments - habit reversal, exposure, and response prevention are he behavioral treatments of choice.\nAdrenergic alpha-2 agonists (always to be tried first before starting antipsychotics) -\nclonidine and guanfacine are found to be effective.\nAntipsychotics - aripiprazole and risperidone are effective and preferred over typical antipsychotics. Pimozide and haloperidol may be more efficient but are often poorly tolerated and need constant monitoring.\nNote: Botulinum toxin has been used to treat painful focal motor tics affecting the neck muscles.\n\n\n\nThe given clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome. Habit reversal training is used in the treatment of tic disorders like Tourette's.\nThe components of habit reversal training are:\nAwareness training in which the patient is taught self-monitoring to enhance awareness of tic behaviours and urges or sensations indicating that a tic is about to occur.\nCompeting-response training in which the patient is taught to voluntarily perform a behaviour hat is physically incompatible with the tic.\nOptions A and C: Systemic desensitization and flooding are used in the treatment of phobias.

Bell and pad based classical conditioning is the most effective treatment.\nNocturnal enuresis refers to the occurrence of involuntary urination at night after 5 years of age. It may be a normal phenomenon in children up to 5 years of age.\nTreatment for nocturnal enuresis may include:\nBehavioural therapy:\nClassic conditioning with the bell (or buzzer) and pad (alarm) apparatus is the most effective treatment for enuresis.\nDryness is achieved in 50% of the cases.\nBladder training with encouragement or reward for delaying micturition for increasing times uring waking hours is useful but considered inferior to bell and pad.\nPharmacotherapy:\nMedications should be considered if behavioural therapy has failed, and if enuresis is causing impairment in social, family, and school function.\n\nDesmopressin (an antidiuretic) and Reboxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are commonly used drugs. Reboxetine is considered as a safer alternative to imipramine.\nPsychotherapy:\nIt is indicated in cases with chronic enuresis, to deal with any coexisting psychiatric problems and emotional and family difficulties.\n\n\n\nThe child is most likely suffering from a childhood anxiety disorder.\nSelective mutism refers to the lack of speaking (being mute) in one or more specific social situations, commonly in school, but speaking well in other situations, commonly at home.

The ambiguous stimulus is a screen on which the individual projects his or her own needs, thoughts, or conflicts.\nCommonly used projective tests are:\nThematic apperception tes\nRorschach's inkblot tes\nSentence completion tes\nDraw a person tes\nIn Rorschach's inkblot test, 10 bilaterally symmetrical inkblots are shown to the participants. The test is administered in two phases:\nFree association phase- participant's response to the cards is recorded\nInquiry phase- participants explain why they formed the impression.\n\n\n\nThe picture given is employed for personality assessment in the thematic apperception test (TAT). It is a projective test intended to evaluate a person's personality through their responses to ambiguous pictures.\nThe TAT consists of a series of 20 pictures that depict individuals of both sexes and of different age groups involved in different activities.

How should the psychiatrist record his mood and affect?\nElevated mood and excited affec\nEuphoric mood and energetic affec\nEuphoric mood and restless affec\nElevated mood and labile affec\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 4:\n\nIn this scenario, the patient's mood is elevated because he seems to be euphoric and excited. His affect is labile because there is excessive variation in emotions without any apparent reason (from smiling one moment, to being quiet, then laughing).\nMood is a pervasive and sustained emotional state experienced subjectively by the patient. It is not always readily observable. It can be characterized as follows:\nDysphoric- includes sustained emotional states such as sadness, anxiety, or irritability.\nElevated- an exaggerated feeling of well-being, euphoria, or elation.\nExpansive- lack of restraint in expressing feelings, frequently with an over-valuation of one\u2019s significance or importance.\nIrritable- easily annoyed or angered.\nEuthymic- mood in the normal range.\nAffect is the cross-section of mood at a given point in time. It fluctuates with time and context. It can be observed by the clinician. It can be characterized as follows:\nQuality (or tone) of a patient's affect includes being happy, irritable, angry, agitated, tearful, sobbing, and flat.\nQuantity of affect is a measure of its intensity. e.g., mildly depressed or severely depressed.\nRange can be restricted, normal, or labile.\nAppropriateness is described in relation to the social situation.\nCongruency is described in relation to the thought content of the person.\n\n\n",

Congruency is described in relation to the thought content of the person. In this situation, the man is speaking about his mother's death and is expected to be sad, but he is laughing. His laughter is not congruent with the content of his speech and\nthoughts.\nOption B: Labile affect denotes excessive variations in emotion without any apparent reason. For example, a person starts laughing and then crying for no reason. This is seen in mania.\nOption C: Affective flattening/flat affect is used to describe a severely restricted range of affect\n(absence of changes in emotion irrespective of the situation).

The thoughts last for 5-10 minutes, after which she gets a seizure; then the thoughts disappear and she feels better. What is this phenomenon called?\nObsession\nThought crowding\nForced thinking\nThought insertion\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn the above scenario, the patient has forced thinking. The thoughts formed are not in control of the patient and are distressing.\n\nForced thinking is one of the recognized pre-ictal events (auras) occurring in focal epilepsy or more specifically, in frontal lobe epilepsy. It usually resolves after the episode of seizure.\nPre-ictal events (auras) in complex partial epilepsy include:\nAutomatisms (classical) - e.g., lip-smacking, rubbing, chewing.\nCognitive sensations - e.g., deja vu, jamais vu, forced thinking, dreamy states.\nAutonomic sensations - e.g., fullness in the stomach, blushing, changes in respiration.\nAffective states - e.g., fear, panic, depression, elation.\nOption A: Obsessions are recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted and cause anxiety or distress to the patient. It is seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nOption B: Thought crowding is characterized by too many thoughts occurring at the same time in the field of consciousness. It is perceived as unpleasant and induces the feeling that ideas are difficult to catch. It is seen in mood disorders such as hypomania and bipolar disorder.\nOption D: Thought insertion is a disorder of thought possession in which the patient feels\nthat thoughts are being inserted into his mind by some external agent.

Freud ascribed parapraxis to unconscious motives.\nOption B: Transference - A situation where the feelings, desires, and expectations of one person are redirected and applied to another person. Most commonly, transference occurs in a therapeutic setting, where a person in therapy unconsciously develop feelings towards the therapist.\nOption C: Repression - is a key concept of psychoanalysis, where it is understood as a defense mechanism. It ensures that what is unacceptable to the conscious mind - and would, if recalled arouse anxiety - is prevented from entering into it.\n\nOption D: Displacement - Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. E.g., a man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from the workplace onto his family.\nCatharsis: The expression of ideas, thoughts, and suppressed emotions by the patient which provides a sense of relief.

The next step would be to test the validity of this automatic thought.\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is based on the psychological significance of the cognitive triad:\nAn individual's beliefs about themselves\nTheir personal world (including the people in their lives)\nTheir future.\nProblematic and biased interpretations related to this cognitive triad may lead to excessive emotional distress.\nCBT is applied to identify these faulty ideas and beliefs, make the patient aware of the underlying assumptions that drive them, and modifying their responses to them.\nThe three components of cognitive therapy are:\nDidactic aspects: Explaining to patients the cognitive triad, schemas, and faulty logic. The herapist must explain all the aspects of treatment.\nCognitive techniques: These involve four steps-\nEliciting automatic thoughts - Asking the patient about the thought that causes the emotional reaction in them.\nTesting validity of the automatic thoughts\nIdentifying the general maladaptive assumptions (a belief that is false and rationally unsupported)\nTesting the validity of maladaptive assumptions\nBehavioral techniques like relaxation techniques and desensitization to the stimulus etc.\nCBT is used in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, depression, phobia, OCD, personality disorders, and somatoform disorders.\n\n\n",

It is also used in the treatment of phobias.\nSystemic desensitization is based on the behavioral principle of counter-conditioning. Here, the person overcomes anxiety elicited by a situation or an object by approaching the feared situation gradually and in a relaxed state.\nSystematic desensitization consists of three steps:\nRelaxation training - patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. The negative reaction of anxiety is inhibited by the relaxed state, a process called reciprocal inhibition.\nHierarchy construction - Patients and therapists prepare a graded list (or hierarchy) of fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.\nDesensitization of the stimulus - Patients proceed systematically through the list from the leas o the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.\nOption A: Describes a patient with bulimia nervosa.\nOption C: Describes a patient with major depressive episode. Option D: Describes a patient with schizophreniform disorder.\n\n",

Patients learn to remain in the feared situation until they feel calm.\nSystematic desensitization - employs counter conditioning and reciprocal inhibition. It is used in the treatment of OCD and phobias.\nTherapeutic graded exposure - similar to systematic desensitization, but there is no relaxation training. The treatment is carried out in a real-life context.\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) - inducing saccades (quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation) when a person is imagining an anxiety-producing event. The saccades can yield a positive thought which decreases anxiety. It is used in PTSD and phobias.\n\n\n",

The stages of motivational enhancement therapy:\nPre-contemplation - People are often unaware that their behavior (eg. alcohol abuse) is problematic or produces negative consequences.\n\nContemplation - People recognize their problem and begin to think about changing their behavior. They weigh the pros and cons of change. People may still feel ambivalent toward changing their behavior.\nPreparation (Determination) - People have made a decision to change their habits and are ready o take action. People start to take small steps toward behavior change.\nAction - People have recently changed their behavior and intend to keep moving forward with hat behavior change\nMaintenance - People have sustained their behavior change for a while and intend to maintain he behavior change going forward.

He is weighing the pros and cons of behaviour modification. This is characteristic of the stage of contemplation.\nAddiction recovery usually involves the following five stages\nPrecontemplation\nContemplation\nPreparation\nAction\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nIn the given scenerio aversion therapy is used.\nAversion: When a noxious stimulus/punishment is given after a specific behavior, the behavior is eventually inhibited. It is used in the treatment of alcohol abuse, paraphilias, opioid addicts.\nDisulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Ethanol consumption during disulfiram therapy can lead to increased concentrations of acetaldehyde. Increased acetaldehyde levels can cause flushing, pulsating headache, throbbing pain in head and neck, and other aversive reactions.\nDisulfiram can only be given to highly motivated individuals. It should not be administered until the person has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. The disulfiram-alcohol reaction may occur as long as 1 or 2 weeks after the last dose of disulfiram.\n\nDisulfiram like reaction with alcohol ingestion is also seen with the following drugs:\nMetronidazole\nSulfonylureas like chlorpropamide\nCephalosporins like cefoperazone, cefamandole.\n\nNeuropsychiatric Aspects of Systemic Disorders\n",

Raw: Question 11:\n\nA 45-year-old woman, brought in by her husband, presented with complaints of short-term memory loss and weight gain for the last 4 months, despite a loss of appetite. She thought that her husband wished to harm her and also felt agitated by all the small animals she kept seeing in her room. You order tests related to thyroid disorders. Which of the following findings would you expect to see in the report?\nIncreased tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels\nIncreased titre of antibodies to thyroid stimulating hormone receptors\nIncreased anti-thyroid peroxidase titre\nDecreased thyroid stimulating hormone levels\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe patient complains of neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory disturbances, along with weight gain despite a loss of appetite. Thus, she has symptoms of hypothyroidism. Increased anti-thyroid peroxidase titer is found in Hashimoto encephalopathy, which is consistent with her symptoms.\nOn the other hand, antibodies to TSH receptors (Grave's disease), decreased TSH, and elevated T3 levels are found in hyperthyroid conditions.\nHashimoto encephalopathy (HE), also described as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), is an uncommon autoimmune encephalopathy of unknown etiology. It is associated with high titers of serum antithyroid (usually anti-thyroid peroxidase \u00b1 anti-thyroglobulin) antibodies.\nHE is more common in women, with a mean age of onset between 45 and 50 years.\nThe clinical picture is one of encephalopathy with progressive cognitive decline which may be relapsing and remitting. Neuropsychiatric features include agitation and restlessness, apathy, social isolation. Visual hallucinations and delusions are commonly seen.\nAnti-thyroid peroxidase levels are very high (&gt;1,000 IU/L) when associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\n\n\n",

The woman has difficulty in getting motivated, memory deficits, and urinary incontinence.\nFrontal lobe injury is commonly due to trauma, infarcts, tumors, lobotomy, multiple sclerosis, or Pick's disease. The following features may be seen in a patient with frontal lobe injury:\nImpaired executive functions such as motivation, attention, and sequencing of actions\nAphasia, apraxia, constructional apraxia, neglect, and memory deficits\nUrinary incontinence and fecal incontinence is commonly seen\nChanges in personalit\nApathetic indifference and impulsive behavior.\nNote: Frontal lobe pathology may become apparent only under unstructured, stressful, real-life situations and are difficult to detect using Intelligence scales, as IQ mostly requires parietal lobe activation.\n\n\n\nAmong the given options, acute infection can be a cause of delirium tremens in an alcoholic patient.\nPhysical illness e.g., hepatitis or pancreatitis predisposes to the syndrome; a person in good physical health rarely has delirium tremens during alcohol withdrawal.\nThe syndrome usually develops on the third day of admission. A patient admitted for an unrelated condition may unexpectedly have an episode of delirium, which is the first sign of a previously undiagnosed alcohol-related disorder.\nEpisodes of delirium tremens usually begin at the age of 30-40 years, after 5 to 15 years of heavy drinking, and are typical after a binge. Gradual withdrawal of alcohol does not cause delirium tremens. However, sudden withdrawal can cause it.\nTreatment of alcohol withdrawal:\nFor patients showing withdrawal symptoms, chlordiazepoxide 25-50 mg every 2-4 hours can be administered orally.\nFor patients with delirium tremens, 50-100 mg of chlordiazepoxide should be administered every 4 hours.\nIf oral administration of drugs is not possible, intravenous lorazepam can be tried.\n\n\n\nSchizophrenia\n\n",

What is the appropriate medical management?\nHaloperidol\nLorazepam\nClonidine\nPropanolol\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe clinical features are suggestive of a catatonic disorder. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective in the treatment of catatonia.\nCatatonia is a syndrome characterized by striking behavioral abnormalities such as motoric immobility or excitement, negativism, or echolalia (mimicry of speech), or echopraxia (mimicry of movement).\nThe clinical picture may include three or more of the following features:\nStupor: Absence of psychomotor activity and not actively relating to the environment.\nCatalepsy: Passive induction of a posture held against gravity.\nWaxy flexibility: Slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner.\nNegativism: Opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli.\nPosturing: Spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity.\nMannerism: Odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions.\nStereotypy: Repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements\nAutomatic obedience: Commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature.\nGrimacing\nAmbitendency: Due to ambivalence, opposing actions are carried out.\nEchopraxia: Mimicking another's movement.\nEcholalia: Mimicking another's speech.\nMutism: Very little or no verbal response to instructions or external stimuli.\nVerbigeration: Incomprehensible speech. Catatonic disorder may occur due to:\nAdvanced mood or psychotic illnesses\nNeurological disorders (e.g., nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and head trauma)\n\nInfections (e.g., encephalitis)\nMetabolic disturbances (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia)\nDrugs induced- like corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antipsychotics (i.e., neuroleptic) agents.\nManagement: The primary treatment includes:\nIdentifying and treating underlying medical or pharmacological causes. Any offending substances should be removed.\nBenzodiazepines, especially, lorazepam, are effective in improving the symptoms.\nElectroconvulsive therapy is the definitive treatment in cases of life-threatening catatonia (if the patient is unable to eat) or if the patient has developed malignant catatonia.\n\n\n",

What is the management of the condition?\nLorazepam\nPromethazine\nOlanzapine\n\nStop antipsychotic\n\n\n\n[EXPLANATION START]\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given clinical scenario is suggestive of oculogyric crisis and promethazine is used for the management.\nOculogyric crisis refers to the spasm of the extraocular muscles, usually causing upward and outward deviation of the eyes. It is a severe form of acute dystonia, an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics like risperidone. It can be treated by drugs with antimuscarinic activities like promethazine.\nDystonia is acute in onset and occurs within 1-5 days of starting treatment. It is more common in the younger population. The proposed mechanism of action is D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway. There is typical involvement of head and neck muscles and presents in a variety of forms, such as torticollis, trismus, mouth opening dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.\nRisperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with D2 blocking but strong 5HT2 antagonistic activity. Its main side effects include weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia,\ndyslipidemia, fatigue, etc. At low doses, extrapyramidal side effects are less, but can be significant\n\nin higher doses. Extrapyramidal side effects include;\nParkinsonism: Features are bradykinesia, rigidity, variable tremor, masked facies, and shuffling gait.\nAcute dystonia: Which causes spasms of muscles of the tongue, face, eyes, neck, back, etc.\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome: Extreme rigidity, fever, unstable blood pressure,myoglobinemia, etc.\nRabbit syndrome: Perioral tremors occur as a delayed variant of parkinsonism. Other options:\nOption A: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. Its adverse effects include sedation, light-headedness, confusional state, weight gain, etc.\nOption C: Olanzapine is also an atypical antipsychotic. Its adverse effects are dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance etc.\n\n\n",

It is one of the 4A\u2019s of schizophrenia as described by Bleuler.\nThe first rank symptoms of schizophrenia described by Kurt Schneider include :\nHallucination:\nFirst-person hallucination (audible thoughts) - auditory hallucinations of the person\u2019s own voice being spoken aloud.\nSecond-person hallucination (voices directly addressing the patient) - auditory hallucinations of 1 or more voices talking directly to the person. They can be persecutory, complimentary, or issue commands (command hallucination)\nThird-person hallucination (voices speaking about the patient) - auditory hallucinations of 1 or more voices speaking about the person. The voice may deliver a running commentary or the voices maybe be arguing/discussing the person.\nThought phenomenon:\nThought withdrawal- thoughts being actively removed from a person\u2019s mind.\nThought insertion- thoughts inserted into a person\u2019s mind by some external agent.\nThought broadcasting- the sense that a person\u2019s thoughts are experienced by others - the thoughts are made audible or may be experienced by others through telepathy.\nMade phenomenon:\nMade affect- feelings are imposed on that person by an external agent.\nMade impulses or drives - an impulse for action is imposed on a person by some external agent.\nMade volitional acts - a person\u2019s actions are controlled by an external agent; the person is a passive participant in the action.\n\nDelusional perception- the person attaches an abnormal significance/meaning to a normal perception, which leads to delusional interpretation. The most common delusion in schizophrenia is the delusion of persecution. These persecutory fears of the patient can range from transient doubts to profound convictions that people are plotting to have them tortured or killed.\nSomatic passivity- tactile or visceral hallucinations that are thought to be imposed on a person's body by some external agent.\nThese symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia and may also be present in other psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n",

DSM-5 criteria for schizoaffective disorder:\n\nAn uninterrupted period of illness where there is a mood episode (depression or mania) concurrent with psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, etc.)\nDelusions or hallucinations (psychotic symptoms) for at least two weeks in the absence of a major depressive or manic episode during the lifetime course of the illness.\nMood symptoms present for the majority of total illnesses.\nNot due to intake of substances or another medical condition. Differential diagnosis:\nMajor depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features: Psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes.\nSchizophrenia: Mood symptoms are absent or present for only brief periods during the course of the illness dominated by psychotic symptoms.\nNote: According to DSM-5 guidelines, for a definitive diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, there have to be two psychotic episodes. One of the psychotic episodes has to be concurrent with a severe affective (depression or manic) episode. The other psychotic episode should be for two or more weeks in the absence of affective symptoms.

Clozapine itself is known to sometimes trigger delirium.\nNote: IV regimens of haloperidol are mostly used in the ICU in the critically ill due to their fast onset of action and predictable pharmacokinetics. Oral haloperidol may be used as a maintenance regimen in patients with a functional GI tract. Intramuscular haloperidol is considered only in acutely combative patients without IV access.\n\nThe next step in management should be a reduction in the dose of levodopa.\nThe patient presents with disorientation, confusion and altered sensorium. This is suggestive of delirium. Anti-parkinsonian agents are frequently implicated in causing delirium because of dopamine increase.\nDecreasing the dosage of the antiparkinsonian agent has to be weighed against worsening of motor symptoms.\nClozapine is recommended when:\nThe antiparkinsonian agents cannot be further reduced\nDelirium persists even after reducing the dose of antiparkinsonian agents\nIf a patient is not able to tolerate clozapine, alternative antipsychotic agents should be considered.\n\nDementia\n\n",
