A skin biopsy is taken which shows the following histopathological finding. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n\n\nPsoriasis\nMycosis fungoides\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nLichen planus\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Key\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Explanations\nSolution to Question 1:\nThe above image shows nucleated stratum corneum suggestive of parakeratosis commonly seen in psoriasis and actinic keratosis.\nParakeratosis refers to abnormal keratinization in which the cells of basal layer divide rapidly reaching the stratum corneum faster and do not have time to shed the nucleus. As a result, the nucleated stratum corneum is observed on histopathology.\nHyperkeratosis refers to the increased thickness of the stratum corneum. This is observed in psoriasis, lichen planus, and ichthyosis.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nThe above image shows intercellular edema involving the stratum spinosum which is suggestive of spongiosis. Spongiosis is the characteristic histopathological feature of acute eczema.\n\nIn contrast, ballooning degeneration is a term that refers to the intracellular edema occurring in the stratum spinosum. This results in acantholysis. Ballooning degeneration is often seen secondary to viral infections like herpes.\nThe image below shows ballooning degeneration (intracellular edema is seen).\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nMicroabscess is not typical of lichenoid tissue reactions. Skin changes in lichenoid tissue reactions:\nUpper dermis - Band\u25a0like infiltrate of mononuclear cells.\nDermoepidermal junction - Saw\u25a0toothed pattern.\nBasal cell layer - Liquefaction degeneration, colloid body formation.\nEpidermis - Increase in thickness. Lichenoid reactions are seen in:\nLichen planus\nLupus erythematosus\nLichen sclerosis\nPoikilodermas\nCutaneous drug eruptions.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\n\nThe given scenario with symptoms of purple, itchy, plaque exhibiting Koebner's phenomenon is suggestive of lichen planus. It is characterized by the presence of Civatte bodies or colloid bodies as seen in the image above.\nThe colloid body is a homogeneous, eosinophilic, rounded body resulting from the degeneration and death of keratinocytes, particularly in the lower layers of the epidermis. This structure is found in various lichenoid tissue reactions.\nOption A: Copper penny bodies are seen in chromoblastomycosis.\n\n\nOption C: Donovan bodies are seen in granuloma inguinale.\n\n\nOption D: Kamino bodies are eosinophilic globules seen in the epidermis or in the region of the dermal-epidermal junction in the spindle and epithelioid cell (Spitz) naevi.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nAcantholysis is not seen in bullous pemphigoid as it is associated with subepidermal blistering.\nAcantholysis is the loss of intercellular connections, such as desmosomes, resulting in the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes.\nAcantholysis is classified as:\nThe image below shows acantholysis (note the rounded and free-floating, detached keratinocytes).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nAcanthosis is characterized by the increase in the number of cells of the stratum spinosum leading to its increased thickness.\nAcanthosis is commonly accompanied by other histological changes such as hypergranulosis, hyperkeratosis, and papillomatosis. It is seen in verruca vulgaris, chronic eczema, lupus vulgaris.\nKindly note that this should not be confused with the term acantholysis. Acantholysis refers to the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes due to the breakdown of intercellular bridges formed by desmosomes. This can be seen in various pemphigus-related disorders and secondary to bullous impetigo and other infections.\n\nThe image below shows acanthosis. Notice the increased thickness of the Malpighian layer and the elongated rete ridges.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe above image showing abnormal epidermal cell keratinization suggestive of dyskeratosis along with the clinical presentation points to a likely diagnosis of Bowen's disease.\nDyskeratosis is characterized by nuclear pyknosis and condensation of the cytoplasm of keratinocytes.\nThis can occur in:\nMalignant lesion - squamous cell carcinoma\nPremalignant lesions:\nBowen disease\nPaget\u2019s disease\nSolar keratosis\nBenign conditions:\nDarier disease\nHailey Hailey disease\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe above image shows upward elongation of the dermal papillae, giving an accentuated and sometimes irregular, undulating configuration to the dermal-epidermal junction which is suggestive of papillomatosis. The feature is commonly seen in psoriasis, and a wide variety of\n\nother inflammatory and neoplastic cutaneous disorders.\nOption B: Parakeratosis can be defined as the retention of keratinocyte nuclei within the stratum corneum. It is commonly seen in psoriasis.\n\n\nOption C: Saw toothing refers to the pattern of the dermal-epidermal junction where dermal papillae are expanded and the tips of the rete pegs are pointed. It is seen in lichen planus and other lichenoid reactions.\n\n\nOption D: Villi refers to elongated dermal papillae usually covered with a single layer of epidermal cells, which form the base of a blister cavity as a result of suprabasal acantholysis. It is seen in various forms of pemphigus and Darier disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nNeutrophilic micro-abscesses are seen in psoriasis.\nA microabscess is a small cavity in the epidermis or dermis formed by collections of leucocytes. Some types of microabscesses and their examples are given below:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nIn the given image, the arrow points to a small collection of cells seen within the stratum corneum in a patient with psoriasis. This is suggestive of a Munro's microabscess.\nMunro's microabscesses are small collections of neutrophil polymorphs. Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis are also seen here.\nThe spongiform pustule of Kogoj refers to the multilocular micropustules that form in the spinous layer of the epidermis in pustular psoriasis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe arrow mark is pointing towards a collection of atypical lymphocytes in the epidermis termed as Pautrier microabscess. This is a very important histopathology feature of mycoses fungoides which is the most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe above image shows malignant lymphocytes that have migrated to the epidermis from the dermis which is called epidermotropism. It is seen in mycosis fungoides.\nPautrier's microabscess constituting a collection of atypical T-cells in the epidermis is also a feature of mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma).\nThe image below shows atypical lymphocytes showing epidermotropism and the formation of Pautrier's microabscesses (H&amp;E stain, 4\u2022\u2022x).\n\n\n\nMorphology and Investigations of Skin Lesions\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nWhich of the following is a primary skin lesion?\nCrust\nAtrophy\nPurpura\nInduration\n\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nWhich of the following is a secondary skin lesion?\n\n\nImage 1\nImage 2\nImage 3\nImage 4\n\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nWhich of the following cannot be considered as a primary lesion of skin?\n\n1, 2 and 4\n2 and 5\n1, 3 and 4\n3 and 5\n\n\nQuestion 4:\n\nA patient presents to the dermatology OPD with the following finding.

Crust, atrophy, and induration are secondary lesions.\nIt is a condition with red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin. It is seen:\nVasculitis\nThrombocytopenia\n\nVitamin C deficiency\n\n\n\nOption A: Crusts or scabs consist of dried-up discharge from the lesions.\n\n\nOption B: Atrophy refers to loss of tissue. There may be fine wrinkling and increased translucency if the process is superficial.\nOption D: Induration refers to dermal thickening that clinically presents as skin that feels thicker and firmer than normal on palpation.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nImage 4 shows an ulcer with crusting. This is a secondary skin lesion.\n\nImages 1, 2, and 3 show a bulla, a papule, and a patch respectively. All of these are primary skin lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nExcoriation and crusts are secondary skin lesions. Wheal, macule and pustule are primary skin lesions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe given image shows lichenification.\nIt is a secondary skin lesion characterized by hyperpigmentation, thickening of the skin, and exaggerated skin markings. It is a feature of chronic eczema.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nA macule is a flat, circumscribed, non\u25a0palpable lesion of less than 1 cm that differs in color from the surrounding skin. It can be of any color or shape.\nOption B: A patch is a lesion of similar description but of size &gt;1 cm. Option C: An ecchymosis is macular area of hemorrhage &gt; 1 cm Option D: A papule is a raised lesion &lt; 1 cm.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given biopsy shows parakeratosis. It is associated with visible scales or visible exfoliation of the skin that consists of flakes of stratum corneum.\nParakeratosis refers to the presence of nucleated keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. It is indicative of a high turnover of keratinocytes. It is associated with thickening of the stratum corneum and visibly presents as scaling. The scales represent compacted desquamated layers of stratum corneum.\nThe following image shows visible fragments of the stratum corneum as it is shed from the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe given image shows collarette scales, which are a characteristic feature of pityriasis rosea.\nCollarette refers to a scale with an adherent outer border and detachable inner border. It appears like a rim around the lesion as seen below.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nA linear crack or discontinuation of the skin surface is called a fissure.\nOption A: Ulcer refers to a loss of dermis and epidermis, often involving underlying tissue as well.\n\nOption B: Excoriation refers to loss of skin substance, specifically produced by scratching.\nOption C: Erosion refers to a loss of the epidermis, which heals without scarring. It commonly follows a blister.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThis clinical scenario is suggestive of obstructive jaundice, which is associated with severe itching. Hence, you would expect to see excoriations or scratch marks.\nThe pruritis occurring in obstructive jaundice is due to cholestasis. The bile salts deposit in the skin, causing saponification of the fat surrounding the nerve endings. This leaves the nerves exposed, producing the sensation of a severe itch.\nIt involves loss of skin substance till the level of the epidermis or upper dermis. Almost all pruritic conditions (except lichen planus) cause excoriation.\nThe image given below shows excoriations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given image showing a round lesion without central clearing is called a nummular (coin-like)\nor a discoid lesion.\nBoth, the edge and center are equally active and uniformly colored. It is seen in discoid eczema, psoriasis.\nOption A: Annular lesions are ring-shaped with central clearing i.e., only the edges are active and appear raised, or in a different color. It is seen in tinea corporis, granuloma annulare.\n\n\nOption C: Arcuate lesions are arc-shaped or incomplete circles.\n\n\n\nOption D: Polycyclic lesions are several circles that have merged together.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThis image shows fish-like scales on the skin that is characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris.\nIt is an autosomal dominant condition that is associated with filaggrin mutations. This leads to a reduction in the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in the skin. It develops at 3-12 months of life and presents with generalized, itchy, small, light-grey scales and xerosis that are more marked over extensor surfaces and trunk. The groin and flexures are spared.\nlinked recessive ichthyosis occurs only in males. It results in larger, dirty-brown scales.\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nA bulla is a circumscribed elevation of &gt; 1 cm in diameter.\nBullae can be multilocular due to coalesced vesicles, as seen in eczema, or unilocular.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThis image shows typical target lesions, characteristically seen in erythema multiforme. It is also called an iris or bull's eye lesion and typically consists of 3 zones as follows:\nCentral area of dusky erythema or purpura\nMiddle paler zone of edema\nOuter ring of erythema with a well-defined edge\nAtypical target lesions with only 2 zones may be seen in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nHailey\u2013Hailey disease has an intertriginous distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nThe given image shows serpiginous or serpent-like skin lesions, which are characteristically seen in cutaneous larva migrans or ground itch.\nIt is caused by the larvae of various hookworm or Ancylostoma species. The parasite is acquired from direct skin contact with soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. It is common following travel to endemic or tropical areas and symptoms develop within the first 2 weeks.\nThe site of entry is marked by an inflamed papule, often located between the toes. Serpentine or linear single-track lines later appear as the larvae migrate through the epidermis. The lesions can enlarge as much as 1 to 2 cm per day.\nThe first-line treatment is oral ivermectin at 200 \uf06dg/kg. Oral albendazole is an alternative treatment.\nNote: Larva currens is caused by the migrating larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. It also produces serpiginous lesions and can be differentiated by the faster rate of progression and haphazard distribution of lesions.\nThe image below shows serpiginous larval tracks over the skin.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe yellowish greasy scales on the scalp of an infant are characteristic of seborrheic dermatitis.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis is a common, inflammatory skin condition that causes the formation of flaky, white to yellowish greasy scales on oily areas such as the scalp, forehead, nose, or inside the ear. It is known as cradle cap when it affects the scalp of infants, as shown in the image below:\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: Impetigo presents with shallow bullae. When ruptured, they result in erosions and discharge that forms honey-colored crusting.\n\n\nOption C: Atopic dermatitis presents in infants as an itchy erythematous rash that affects the face and flexural areas such as elbows. The given image shows atopic dermatitis on the abdomen and thigh of an infant:\n\n\n\nOption D: Tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp. It is uncommon in infants. It is common in older children and presents as patches of alopecia associated with scaling or black dots (swollen hair shafts).\nThe given image shows severe tinea capitis infection with follicles discharging pus, this clinical variant is known as kerion:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nLoss of temperature sensation is not associated with poikiloderma. Poikiloderma is a special skin lesion with a triad of features:\nCutaneous pigmentation (both hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation)\nSkin atrophy\n\nTelangiectasia\nIt may be congenital or acquired. It is associated with mycosis fungoides, dermatomyositis, xeroderma pigmentosum, etc.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nIn patch testing, the patch is removed after 48 hours to examine the site of reaction.\nPatch testing is a test to detect sensitivity to a specific allergen. A battery of suspected allergens is applied to the patient\u2019s back under occlusive dressings or patches. It is allowed to remain in contact with the skin for 48 hours.\n48 hours: Patch removal for initial reading to detect delayed hypersensitivity reaction.\n72-96 hours: Final reading done for confirmation.\nNote: Since the question is regarding the timing of patch removal and not regarding the final diagnosis, 48 hours is the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nIvory or milky-white fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is seen in vitiligo.\nIn vitiligo, there is less or no epidermal melanin in the affected patches. As the normal function of melanin is to absorb light, the vitiligo-affected patches cannot block the light emitted from deeper layers of the skin. They appear as bluish, milky, or ivory white patches with sharp margins. Woods lamp is hence helpful in the diagnosis of vitiligo, especially in fair-skinned people in whom lesions may not be obvious to the naked eye.\nThe following image shows milky-white fluorescence under a Wood's lamp.\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nCoral pink fluorescence on Wood's lamp examination is characteristic of erythrasma.\nErythrasma is a skin infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. It is common in diabetics and immunodeficient patients and is associated with obesity, sweating and poor hygiene.\nCoral pink fluorescence is due to the production of coproporphyrin III by the bacterium.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nHansen's disease is diagnosed by slit skin smear for acid-fast bacilli using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique.\nSome important findings on Tzanck smear are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe test depicted in the given image is diascopy.\nIt involves pressing a glass slide or a stiff, clear, colorless piece of plastic onto the skin to cause blanching by compressing blood out of small vessels. This allows other colors to be evaluated.\nSome uses of diascopy are as follows:\nApple jelly nodules - Yellow-brown lesions seen in lupus vulgaris and sarcoidosis.\nSpider naevi - Compression of radiating arterioles is noted.\nDifferentiation of erythema (disappears) and purpura (remains unaltered). The image given below shows apple-jelly nodules on diascopy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\n10% neutral buffered formalin is the most widely used fixative for routine diagnostic microscopy of paraffin-embedded tissue samples.\nSkin biopsies are indicated in various conditions like epidermal or dermal neoplasms as well as blistering disorders for immunofluorescence. Michel's medium is used as a transport medium.\nVarious techniques of skin biopsy are available based on the lesions to be biopsied:\n\n\nSolution to Question 24:\nThe microscopic picture described in this clinical scenario is called spaghetti and meatball appearance. It is diagnostic of pityriasis versicolor or tinea versicolor.\nSkin scrapings from the lesions are mounted in 10-30% potassium hydroxide. A\nhigher percentage of KOH solution speeds up the process. It is then observed under fluorescence microscopy using a fluorescent brightener like Calcofluor white or Blankophor which specifically stains polysaccharides in the fungal cell wall.\nThe hyphae and spherical Malassezia yeasts are called spaghetti and meatballs or bananas and grapes appearance as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 25:\nThe given image shows a photo-patch test. Skin reaction is seen on the uncovered side that is exposed to UV rays.\nPhoto-patch test is useful in the diagnosis of photosensitive rashes and photoallergic contact dermatitis that are typically localized to the sun-exposed areas of the skin.\nUV light is used at a dose sufficient to trigger the photoallergic response, without causing a false positive phototoxic reaction. It is performed like a conventional patch test, except two sets of allergens are applied over the back. The control set of allergens and the rest of the skin\nare covered with an opaque material. The patient is positioned 15 cm from a UV lamp and the test site is irradiated with UV light.\nThis test is best read after 48 hours. In the case of a positive test indicating photoallergy, the exposed side shows a reaction.",
