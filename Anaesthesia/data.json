Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or hypertension or complicated diabetes is included under ASA-PS Class III.\nNote: If the question was about well-controlled diabetes or mild diabetes without complications, the answer would be ASA-PS Class II.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nASA-PS classification is used to quantify patient risk for anesthesia and not for assessment of the airway.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe following are indicators of difficult intubation:\nMallampati class 3 and 4 airways\nThyromental distance &lt;6cm with neck extension\nNeck circumference &gt;17 inches in men and 16 inches in women\nAn inability to extend the neck at the atlantooccipital joint\nA history of previous difficult intubation.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nASA-PS classification describes a patient\u2019s preoperative medical status and strongly correlates with the perioperative risk.\nThe ASA classification system alone does not predict the perioperative risks, but when used with other factors like the type of surgery, frailty and level of deconditioning of the patient, it can be helpful in predicting perioperative risks.\n\nOption A: ASA-PS is used to quantify the risk for patients who require anaesthesia, not assess intubation difficulty.\nOption B: Brain dead patients are classified as ASA-PS class Vl.\nOption C: A patient with anaemia without functional limitation (no symptoms) is classified as ASA-PS class ll.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nIn class III of Mallampati score, both hard and soft palates are visible.\nOption A: Mallampati score is used to predict difficult tracheal intubation based on the size of the tongue base relative to the oropharyngeal space.\nOption B: In class II, only soft palate, fauces, and the portion of uvula are visualized, tonsillar pillars can't be visualized.\nOption C: Higher Mallampati scores (class III and IV) are associated with a greater incidence of difficult intubation and sleep apnea.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nAspirin should be discontinued 3 days before surgery in this patient to mitigate potential intraoperative bleeding.\nHowever, low dose aspirin should be continued to prevent cardiovascular thrombotic events in the following cases:\nPatients with a prior PCI (Percutaneous coronary intervention)\nPatients with coronary artery disease\nPatients with stroke in the past 9 months\nIn addition, aspirin should be continued in patients requiring CABG. This is due to associated increased in-hospital mortality if discontinued.\nDuration for which other antiplatelet drugs should be stopped before surgery-\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nAspirin should be continued in patients requiring CABG procedure.\nDiscontinuation of aspirin in patients requiring CABG procedure is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Hence aspirin is continued before the procedure.\nThe approach for most surgical patients is to discontinue aspirin temporarily for 3 days before surgery to mitigate potential intraoperative bleeding. However, the drug should be continued to prevent cardiovascular thrombotic events in the following:\nPatients with a prior PCI (Percutaneous coronary intervention)\nPatients with coronary artery disease\nPatient with stroke in the past 9 months.\nNote: The use of heparin may paradoxically increase platelet aggregation and is not recommended.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nClopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug and is stopped 1 week prior to surgery to avoid the risk of increased surgical bleeding.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nSince the patient has increased thromboembolic risk (stroke), warfarin is stopped 4-5 days\npre-operatively and LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) is used till the day before(24 hours) surgery.\nIn patients at high risk for thrombosis (e.g., those with certain mechanical heart valve implants or with atrial fibrillation and a prior thromboembolic stroke), warfarin should be stopped and replaced by UFH or LMWH to minimize the risk.\nPatients at lower risk for thrombosis may have warfarin discontinued 4-5 days preoperatively and then reinitiated after successful surgery.\nWarfarin may be continued in patients posted for cataract surgery without a bulbar block.",
