A single umbilical artery is the most common cord abnormality. Anomalies are seen in 30% of cases with a single umbilical artery. The incidence is higher in twin deliveries.\nTrisomy 18 is a common association.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nA ponderal index of &lt;2 suggests asymmetric intrauterine growth\nrestriction. Asymmetric IUGR is associated with a brain-sparing effect, unlike symmetric IUGR, where there is no sparing of head growth.\nPonderal index = Birth weight (gm)/Length (cm)3 x 100.\nIt is a weight-height-related parameter used as an indicator of fetal growth status.\n\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nA ponderal index of 1.75 suggests intrauterine growth restriction. Gestational diabetes usually presents with fetal macrosomia.\nMaternal factors associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR):\nHypertension/renal disease\nDiabetes with placental vasculopathy\nHypoxemia\nMalnutrition\nChronic illness\nSickle cell anemia\nDrugs (narcotics, alcohol, cigarettes, cocaine)\nMaternal infection and parasite infestations\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThick cartilage with a stiff ear in a newborn is a sign of maturity (not prematurity).\nNo creases on the sole, insignificant breast nodule, and empty scrotum are all physical signs of prematurity in a newborn.\nNote:\nAbundant lanugo hair is not discriminatory evidence of prematurity. This is because neonates of diabetic mothers born as a term or even post-term have abundant lanugo hair, especially over the pinna and upper back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThe physical sign of an infant born post-term (43 weeks) in association with presumed placental insufficiency is abundant hair (not scanty hair).\nInfants born post-term in association with presumed placental insufficiency may have various physical signs, together termed as postmaturity syndrome (or dysmaturity syndrome).\nThese include:\nDesquamation, pale skin, and long nails.\nLoose skin around the thighs and buttocks.\nMeconium-stained nails, skin, vernix, and umbilical cord.\nPresence of placental membranes.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nAnemia is not a complication of post-maturity. Polycythemia may be seen in neonates born after 42 weeks of gestation.\nComplications of post-maturity include:\nPerinatal depression\nMeconium aspiration\nPersistent pulmonary hypertension\nHypoglycemia\nHypocalcemia\n\nPolycythemia\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe most likely diagnosis is caput succedaneum.\nCaput succedaneum is a diffuse, sometimes ecchymotic, edematous collection of serosanguinous fluid in the subcutaneous layer of the scalp, involving the presenting part in a vertex delivery. It may extend across the midline and crosses suture lines.\nOption A: Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage that is always limited to the surface of 1 cranial bone and does not cross suture lines. The swelling appears only several hours after\nbirth. There is no discoloration of the overlying scalp.\nOption C: Subgaleal hemorrhages occur with the rupture of emissary veins, which connect the dural sinuses with the superficial veins of the scalp. Blood accumulates between the epicranial aponeurosis of the scalp and the periosteum and resolves over 2-3 weeks. Often associated with vacuum-assisted delivery.\nOption D: Epidural hemorrhages, usually traumatic in origin, are associated with cephalo-pelvic disproportion, prolonged labor, breech, precipitous labors, or occur as a result of mechanical assistance in labor. Majority resolve with no intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe area marked B represents a cephalohematoma. It is not a swelling of the soft tissues of the scalp.\nCephalohematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage that is always limited to the surface of 1 cranial bone and does not cross suture lines. The swelling appears only several hours after birth. There is no discoloration of the overlying scalp.\n\nMost cephalohematomas are resorbed within 2 weeks to 3 months, depending on their size. Cephalohematomas require no treatment, although phototherapy may be necessary to treat the associated hyperbilirubinemia (resorption of blood takes place by the breakdown of RBCs).\n\n\n\nOther markings-\nA- Caput succedaneum. It is a diffuse ecchymotic or edematous collection in the soft tissues of the scalp with vertex presentation. It can extend across skull sutures and disappears with the first week of life.\nC- Sub-galeal hemorrhage. This a collection of blood under the aponeurosis of the scalp. It is a large potential space, thus bleeding can be extensive. It occurs as a result of ventouse deliveries due to tears of the emissary veins which connect to the dural venous sinuses. It can also occur in hereditary coagulopathies and in association with skull fractures.\nD- Epidural hemorrhage. Usually traumatic in origin, these are associated with cephalo-pelvic disproportion, prolonged labor, breech, precipitous labors, or as a result of mechanical assistance in labor. Majority resolve with no intervention.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nLeft-hand paralysis with ipsilateral ptosis and miosis in a newborn suggests a diagnosis of Klumpke's paralysis associated with Horner syndrome.\nThere is an injury to the 7th-8th cervical nerves and the 1st thoracic nerve. This produces\na paralyzed hand where the intrinsic muscles of the hand (T1) and the ulnar flexors of the wrist and fingers (C8) are mainly affected, and the baby lies with the forearm supinated and the elbow flexed. There may be a unilateral Horner\u2019s syndrome, characterized by ipsilateral ptosis and miosis if the sympathetic fibers of the 1 thoracic root are also injured.\nOption A: Erb\u2013Duchenne paralysis affects the 5th and 6th cervical nerves. There is loss of abduction of the shoulder, external rotation, and supination. Moro's reflex is absent on the affected side.\n\nOption B: Phrenic nerve palsy (3, 4, and 5 cervical nerves) results in diaphragmatic paralysis. It is characterized by cyanosis and irregular and labored breathing.\nOption C: Horner's syndrome is characterized by miosis, ptosis, enophthalmos, anhydrosis, and loss of ciliospinal reflex.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe clinical vignette suggests a diagnosis of Erb\u2013Duchenne paralysis. The injury is limited to the 5th and 6th cervical nerve roots.\nThe characteristic position consists of adduction and internal rotation of the arm with pronation of the forearm. There is loss of abduction of the shoulder, external rotation, and supination.\nThere is an asymmetric Moro's Reflex\n\nNote:\nIn shoulder dystocia, the most common nerve injury is to the C5-6 nerve root. The most common bone to fracture is the clavicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nThe above pattern of jaundice is suggestive of physiological jaundice/icterus neonatorum. It is due to increased bilirubin production from the breakdown of fetal red blood cells combined with transient limitation in the conjugation of bilirubin by the immature neonatal liver.\nIt first appears on the 2nd or 3rd day, usually peaks on the 4th day at 5\u20136 mg/dL, and decreases to &lt;2 mg/dL between the 5th and 7th days after birth.\nRh incompatibility between maternal and fetal red blood cells leads to pathological jaundice.\n\n\nNote:\nDepth of jaundice (degree of yellowness) should be carefully noted (light staining as lemon-yellow; deep staining as orange-yellow), as it is an important indicator of the level of jaundice. Earlier, the involvement of soles and palms indicated severe jaundice but deep yellow staining (even in absence of yellow soles or palms) may be associated with severe jaundice.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nJaundice associated with a rise in bilirubin level at a rate of &lt;5 mg/dL/24 hours suggests physiological jaundice.\nFeatures suggestive of pathological jaundice:\nJaundice appears within the first 24 hours after birth\nJaundice present at or beyond age 3 weeks or sick infan\nElevated direct (or conjugated) bilirubin level\n\tTotal serum bilirubin levels above the expected normal range; jaundice seen in he mid-abdominal region (\uf0bb 15 mg/dL) and soles (\uf0bb 20 mg/dL)\nTotal serum bilirubin concentration not responding to phototherapy\nTotal serum bilirubin rising rapidly (i.e., crossing percentiles) in an infant receiving phototherapy\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nABO incompatibility is the most common cause of hemolytic disease of newborns and affects the firstborn. It is usually mild and subclinical.\nThis incompatibility between the mother and fetus generally results in milder disease than Rh incompatibility does.\nIt arises when a mother with blood group type O becomes pregnant with a fetus of different blood type (A/B). The mother's serum contains naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs.\nAlthough antibodies against A and B factors occur without previous immunization (natural antibodies), they are usually IgM, which do not cross the placenta. However, IgG antibodies to A antigen may be present, and these do cross the placenta, resulting in A-O iso-immune hemolytic disease in the first-born infant (A-O is more common than B-O).\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe most effective range of wavelength of light for phototherapy in neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia is 460\u2013490 nm (blue-green light).\n\nClinical jaundice and indirect hyperbilirubinemia are reduced by exposure to the high intensity of light in the visible spectrum by 3 mechanisms:\nIrreversible structural isomerization: Most important mechanism; acts by\nforming lumirubin from native bilirubin. It is then excreted by the kidneys in the unconjugated state.\nReversible photo-isomerization reaction: converts toxic unconjugated bilirubin into an unconjugated configurational isomer. It is then excreted in bile without conjugation.\nPhoto-oxidation: minor method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nSn-mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a synthetic metalloporphyrin is a potential alternative medical therapy for pathological jaundice in neonates.\nIt acts by competitive inhibition of the conversion of heme protein to biliverdin by heme oxygenase. A single intramuscular dose on the 1st day of life reduces the need for subsequent phototherapy. Complication from metalloporphyrins includes transient erythema if the infant is receiving phototherapy.\nTolazoline is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that produces systemic and pulmonary vasodilatation, which is used to correct pulmonary artery vasospasm when it causes severe right-left shunting soon after birth.\nTromethamine is an organic buffer used in the management of metabolic acidosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe bronze baby syndrome is a dark, grayish-brown skin discoloration in infants undergoing phototherapy; it mainly occurs in infants with direct hyperbilirubinemia as an adverse effect of\n\nphototherapy.\nDespite the bronze baby syndrome, phototherapy can continue if needed. Other complications of Phototherapy:\nLoose stools\nErythematous macular rash\nThe purpuric rash associated with transient porphyrinemia\nOverheating\nDehydration (increased insensible water loss, diarrhea)\nHypothermia from exposure\nGray baby syndrome is an adverse effect of chloramphenicol. Redman syndrome is an adverse effect of vancomycin.\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe cut-off for the treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia to start IV glucose is a blood glucose level of &lt;40 mg/dL.\nNeonatal hypoglycemia can be suspected when the blood glucose is &lt;45 mg/dL. Clinically in neonates, hypoglycemia can be asymptomatic or symptomatic. The neonate presents with tremors, cyanosis, convulsions, apneic spells, tachypnea, weak and high-pitched cry, lethargy, difficulty in feeding, episodes of sweating, sudden pallor, hypothermia, and rarely cardiac arrest.\nManagement in symptomatic neonates:\nBlood glucose &lt;40mg/dL: IV glucose infusion\nBlood glucose &lt;25mg/dL: Bolus IV dextrose 1-2 mL/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 5-8mL/kg/min.\nManagement in asymptomatic neonates:\nBreastfeeding within 30 minutes\nStart IV glucose therapy if blood glucose &lt;35 mg/dL\nRecheck blood glucose before the next feeding\nContinue skin-to-skin care\nEvaluation for other underlying illnesses\nThe desired target glucose value is &gt;50mg/dL and blood glucose should be rechecked until three normal values.",
