It is characterized by coagulative necrosis.\nIn coagulative necrosis, despite cell death, the outline and architecture of the cells are preserved for a few days. This is because the cell injury is mainly due to the denaturation of all proteins, including the enzymatic proteins. This prevents the proteolysis of the dead cells. Ultimately, these necrotized cells are removed by phagocytosis and the lysosomal action of the enzymes of the leukocytes.\nExamples of coagulative necrosis:\nIschemic injury in all organs, except the brain\nDry gangrene\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe above image shows a pale, wedge-shaped area of infarction in the spleen.\nAn infarct is a region of ischaemic necrosis resulting from the obstruction of blood flow, typically due to occlusion of the arterial supply or venous drainage. The most common cause of solid organ infarts is thromboembolism.\nThe pattern of ischemic necrosis seen in solid organ infarction is coagulative necrosis. However, CNS infarctions are an exception. They cause liquefactive necrosis.\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nThis clinical scenario is suggestive of a stroke, which results in ischemic injury to the brain. This results in liquefactive necrosis.\nLiquefactive necrosis refers to cell death by enzymatic degradation. The brain contains microglial cells, which contain many enzymes. When these cells are broken down, they release these enzymes, resulting in liquefactive necrosis.\nThe various types of necrosis are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe given specimen shows yellow nodules with areas of chalky-white deposits, which are suggestive of fat necrosis.\nFat necrosis results from the release of activated pancreatic lipases into the substance of the pancreas and the peritoneal cavity. These enzymes act on surrounding tissue to release fatty acids, which then combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky-white areas (fat saponification).\nHistologic examination reveals foci of shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells, with basophilic calcium deposits, surrounded by an inflammatory reaction.\nThe various types of necrosis include:\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nImmune reactions involving blood vessels, as seen in the case of polyarteritis nodosa, usually show fibrinoid necrosis. Fibrinoid means fibrin-like.\nIn some immune disorders, the antigen-antibody complexes get deposited in the blood\nvessels. These complexes result in complement activation (type III hypersensitivity) leading to cell injury. This leads to leakage of fibrin out of the blood vessel, giving a pinkish appearance around the blood vessels.\nFibrinoid necrosis is seen in the following conditions:\nSLE\nLibman-sacks endocarditis\nArthus reaction\nSerum sickness\nPolyarteritis nodosa\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\nMalignant hypertension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nInflammasomes are involved in the recognition and clearance of necrotic cells.\nInflammasomes are involved in pyroptosis, a process of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. This process is dependent on caspases 1, 4, and 5 and is responsible for killing of infected cells. It occurs in the following sequence:\nActivation of inflammasome complex by infected cells\nThis causes activation of caspase-1\nThis results in generation of IL-1, which is responsible for fever, inflammation, leukocyte recruitment\nOption B: Toll-like receptors (TLR)- recognizes molecules shared by pathogens\nOption C: P-selectins - an important role in the initial recruitment of WBCs at the site of inflammation &amp; in platelet recruitment and aggregation at the site of injury.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nIn cell injury, there is a loss of glycogen, which leads to a change in cytoplasmic appearance. An increase in glycogen particles is not a feature of cell injury.\nIn cell injury, the following changes are seen in the cytoplasm:\nIncreased eosinophilic staining due to -\nIncrease in denatured proteins (which bind to acidic dyes like eosin)\nLoss of cytoplasmic RNA (nucleic acids bind to basic dyes like hematoxylin)\nGlassy, homogeneous appearance - due to loss of glycogen particles\n\nMoth-eaten appearance - vacuolated appearance due to enzymatic digestion of cytoplasmic organelles\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe plasma membrane remains intact in apoptosis.\nApoptosis literally means falling-off in Greek. It is a pathway of programmed cell death.\nApoptotic cells break up into fragments called apoptotic bodies. These apoptotic bodies have intact plasma membrane but altered structures. Hence, they are subjected to phagocytosis without eliciting inflammation.\nNecrosis is an unprogrammed form of cell death that includes:\nEnzymatic digestion\nAdjacent inflammation\nKaryolysis\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nAtrophy in parenchymal organs after duct obstruction is a pathological cause of apoptosis. Physiological causes of apoptosis:\nDuring embryogenesis - M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor causing apoptosis of the Mullerian structures in the male fetus\nHormone-dependent apoptosis -\nEndometrial cell breakdown during the menstrual cycle\nRegression of the lactating breast after weaning.\nCell loss in proliferating cell populations - turnover of cells of intestinal crypt epithelium\nElimination of neutrophils after an acute inflammatory response and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response\nPathological causes of apoptosis:\nDNA damage beyond repair\nAccumulation of misfolded proteins leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress\nCell injury in certain viral infections (e.g., Councilman bodies in viral hepatitis)\nPathologic atrophy after duct obstruction in parenchymal organs like pancreas, parotid gland, and kidneys\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\n\nBAX and BAK are pro-apoptotic proteins.\nThey get inserted into the mitochondrial membrane and result in the formation of channels. This allows proteins from the inner mitochondrial membrane to leak out into the cytoplasm.\nOn the other hand, antiapoptotic proteins of the BCL2 family, like BCL-2 and BCL-XL limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nSmac, also known as Diablo is not a stress sensor of apoptosis. It is a proapoptotic protein that initiates the caspase cascade by neutralizing IAPs (physiological inhibitors of apoptosis).\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nApoptotic bodies are made up of cytoplasm with tightly packed organelles, and nuclear fragments.\nDuring apoptosis, extensive plasma membrane blebbing occurs, followed by cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies by a process called budding.\nIn apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine, which is normally present on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, flips to the outer leaflet. Hence, it gets recognized by tissue macrophages and leads to phagocytosis of the apoptotic bodies.\nAnnexin V is a marker of apoptosis.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nCaspases are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins at the aspartic acid residue. Hence, the activation of caspases plays a key role in the process of apoptosis.\n\n\n\nThe activation of caspases depends on a finely tuned balance between production of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.\nTwo distinct pathways converge on caspase activation:\nThe mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway\nThe death receptor (extrinsic) pathway\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nFLIP is a cellular protein that inhibits the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.\nIt is a caspase antagonist that inhibits the activation of caspases involved in the extrinsic or death receptor pathway. Some viruses produce homologs of this protein. This may play a role in keeping infected cells alive.\nThere are two pathways that can lead to caspase activation and cause apoptosis of the cell. APAF-1 - Apoptotic peptidase activating factor-1\nTNF - Tumor necrosis factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nIntrinsic and extrinsic pathways are both seen in apoptosis. Apoptosis has two pathways:\nAPAF-1 - Apoptosis activating factor-1 TNF - Tumor necrosis factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe above histopathological image shows Councilman or acidophil bodies. They represent hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis.\nCouncilman bodies are commonly seen in acute viral hepatitis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nCaspase activation does not occur in necroptosis. It is a caspase-independent form of programmed cell death.\n\nNecroptosis is a programmed form of necrosis (which is normally an unprogrammed process). Though the activation of this pathway is similar to apoptosis, there is no activation of caspases, which is an important part of apoptosis.\nNecroptosis is triggered by the activation of TNFR1 by TNF-\uf061. This induces the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 kinase and the formation of a necrosome. The necrosome reduces cellular ATP levels.\nNecroptosis occurs in the following conditions:\nPathological - ischemic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, viral infections\nPhysiological - formation of the mammalian bone growth plate\nThe following table lists the differences between apoptosis and necroptosis:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nCaspases 1, 4, and 5 are involved in pyroptosis, not caspase 8.\nPyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is different from apoptosis and necrosis. It is involved in the clearance of necrotic and microbe-infected cells. It occurs in the following sequence:\nActivation of the inflammasome complex\nActivation of caspase-1\nGeneration of IL-1 - results in fever, inflammation, leukocyte recruitment Pyroptosis differs from apoptosis by the following features:\nThere is cellular swellin\nThere is loss of cell membrane integrity\nIt is associated with inflammation\nCaspases 1, 4, and 5 are involved\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nThe given image shows brownish lipofuscin granules within the liver cells. It is composed of lipid-containing residues of lysosomal digestion that are formed due to autophagocytosis.\nLipofuscin is a wear-and-tear pigment that is due to free radical injury to the tissue. It is prominent in the liver and heart of aging patients or patients with severe malnutrition and cancer cachexia.\nAutophagy is a process by which the cell consumes itself. It involves the sequestration of cellular organelles into cytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes) that fuse with lysosomes, resulting in the digestion of the enclosed material. It occurs in the following conditions:\nAs a survival mechanism during nutrient deprivation and stress conditions\nCancers, inflammatory bowel diseases, neurodegenerative disorders - due to dysregulation\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nMicrotubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) is a reliable marker for cellular autophagy.\nThere is increased synthesis of this molecule during autophagy. LC3 plays a role in elongation and closure of the autophagosomal membrane.\nAutophagy (self-eating) is the process in which the starved cell eats its own components in an attempt to reduce nutrient demand to match the supply.\nOption A: Atg5 protein, although associated with autophagy, is not a reliable marker as there is no differential expression during autophagy initiation.\nOption B: RIP3 (receptor associated kinase 3) is a unique kinase involved in necroptosis. Option D: Annexin V is a marker for cellular apoptosis.",
