It allows for the differentiation of different types of tissues on the X-ray film.\n\n\n\nVery low-energy X-rays are not capable of producing the photoelectric effect. High energy X-rays are also not capable of photoelectric effect due to random scattering of electrons from the outer shell. This is known as the Compton effect and it can lead to distortion of the image.\nThe goal of X-ray imaging should be to minimize the Compton effect and maximize the photoelectric effect. The penetrating power of X-rays increases with increasing energy, which is directly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength.",

When electric current pass through the transducer, these crystals starts to vibrate and produces ultrasound waves. This is called reverse piezoelectric effect.\nThey propagate through different tissues and is reflected back. These waves are then converted back into electrical impulses by the transducer crystals. This is called piezoelectric effect. These impulses are further processed to form an ultrasound image on the screen by pulse-echo principle. Both reverse piezoelectric effect and piezoelectric effect are used in diagnostic ultrasound.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nLead zirconate titanate (PZT) is the most widely used material in the ultrasound transducers/probes. It has replaced the previously used barium titanate.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nBile is not echogenic on ultrasound.\nEchoes are not produced if there is no difference in acoustic density. Hence, homogeneous fluids are seen as echo-free structures. Examples of homogenous fluids include blood, bile, urine, cyst contents, ascites, and pleural effusion.\nHomogenous fluids transmit sound exceptionally well and render increased echoes to those structures deeper to them. This is called acoustic enhancement / posterior enhancement / enhanced through transmission.\nAcoustic shadowing is present behind bony structures, calculi, and air.\n\n\nThe image given below shows posterior enhancement of a renal cyst.\n\n\nThe below image shows a gall bladder stone with acoustic shadowing.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nThe USG image represents the M-mode used for echocardiography. Echo intensity is represented as brightness and a trace is swept across the screen so that the x-axis represents time.\nUltrasonography is a versatile imaging modality known for its portability and safety, particularly as it does not involve radiation exposure. As the safest radiological investigation for pregnancy, it provides crucial information without posing any risks to the mother or fetus, making it indispensable in obstetric care.\nDifferent modes in USG and its uses are as follows:\nA (amplitude) mode: Used in ophthalmology and orbital biometry (option A).\nB (brightness) mode: Used for all routine applications, with brightness encoded as grayscale value (option B).\nM (motion) mode: In echocardiography.\nHIFU (high-intensity focussed USG) is a therapeutic application of USG. It is useful for the treatment of fibroids. HIFU exploits the thermal effects of high-powered, tightly focused ultrasound beams so that very small target tissues can be heated and coagulated.\nThe image below depicts a duplex scan, which is a combination of B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler data acquisition.\n\n\n\nDoppler ultrasound (option D) is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld Doppler ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. A triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise and fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in diastole, and the last wave with a forward flow taking place during diastole.\nDoppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on whether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability.\nThe image below shows triphasic signal on doppler ultrasound:\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nHarmonic imaging is a technique used in sonography.\n\nIn tissue harmonic imaging sonography, higher harmonic frequencies generated by the propagation of the ultrasound beam through tissue are used to produce the sonogram. They result in better images.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe above clinical scenario is suggesting the likelihood of breast abscess and Ultrasonography\n(USG) is the investigation of choice in this condition.\nThis investigation can differentiate between solid and cystic lesions of the breast and is able to detect abnormal axillary lymph nodes.\nUSG is preferred in pregnant, lactating and young women (less than 40 years) since breast tissue is dense in these populations. Mammography is indicated in women over the age of 40 with breast symptoms and signs including screening of breast lump and prolonged puerperal abscesses.\nBreast MRI is the most sensitive method in breast cancer detection.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nThe doppler effect results from an apparent shift in sound frequency as sound waves are reflected from moving targets, usually blood cells. In color doppler, the type of color represents the direction of flow.\nRed - flow is towards the transducer\nBlue - flows is away from the transducer Uses of doppler:\nInvestigation of choice in DVT\nInvestigation of choice in testicular and ovarian torsion\nCarotid artery stenosis screening - if there is stenosis velocity is increased\nIn pregnancy:\nUmbilical artery Doppler for follow up of fetal IUGR\nUterine artery Doppler \u2013 diastolic notch usually disappears after 22 weeks. Persistent diastolic notch in the uterine artery after 22 weeks of gestation is a predictor of pre-eclampsia\nIncreased peak systolic velocity of fetal MCA is an indicator of fetal anemia.\nIn spectral Doppler, flow is represented in a waveform. The image given below shows a spectral doppler of the carotid artery.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nThe Doppler waveform of the venous blood flow in lower limb DVT is monophasic proximal to the level of obstruction.\nThe normal venous waveform shows a variation (phasicity) secondary to respiration referred to as respirophasic waveform. Loss of this phasic variation results in a monophasic waveform suggestive of venous obstruction proximal to the level of interrogation.\nA normal artery has a triphasic signal. The waveform becomes biphasic in mild-moderate stenosis and monophasic in severe stenosis.\nThe image given below shows the normal triphasic signal from an artery.\n\n\nMonophasic waveform:\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nThe magnetic field strength of MRI machines is measured in Tesla. MRI is based on the gyromagnetic property of protons.\nClinical imaging scanners have magnets with field strengths ranging from 0.2 to 3 Tesla (and more recently \u02dc Tesla). Routinely used MRI has a field strength of 1.5 Tesla which is created by superconductors.\nHounsfield scale/ unit (HU) is used to measure the X-ray attenuation values in CT scanning.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nThe given MRI is a T2 weighted image as the CSF appears bright/hyperintense and white matter appears dark.\nMany pulse sequence techniques are used in MRI, and the most classic are T1 and T2 weighted images.\n\n\n\n\nOther options:\nOption A: In T1 weighted images CSF is dark/hypointense, white matter is white and grey matter is dark.\n\n\n\n\nOption C: FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fluid from T2. As a result, CSF is dark. However, white matter is dark and grey matter is bright similar to T2 imaging.\n\n\n\n\nOption D: STIR (short tau inversion recovery) is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fat from T2. So, fat is dark. It is done to detect bone marrow edema in body part scans.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nMRI is contraindicated in patients with metallic foreign bodies in the eye, cardiac pacemakers, and claustrophobia.\nContraindications of MRI include:\nCardiac pacemakers\nAneurysmal metallic clips\nMetallic foreign body\nCochlear implant\nAllergy to gadolinium (in contrast MRI)\nClaustrophobia (relative contraindication)\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nThe contrast agent used for MRI is gadolinium. It acts by reducing both T1 and T2 relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since gadolinium ion is toxic, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used.\nContraindications:\nRenal failure - Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min.\n\nPregnancy - Due to the risk of teratogenicity\nGadolinium does not cross the blood-brain barrier unless the barrier is disrupted.\nOptison and Levovist are ultrasound contrast agents. Ultrasound contrast agents are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nMRI rooms are shielded completely by a continuous sheet or wire mesh of copper called Faraday cage, which provides radiofrequency (RF) shielding.\nFaraday cage is a conductive box used to shield out stray electromagnetic interference. It is most commonly made of wood panels wrapped with copper. Other metals like aluminium and galvanized steel can also be used. It serves two functions:\nTo prevent external radiofrequency pulses from interfering with the detector\nTo prevent radiofrequency pulses generated by the scanner from interfering with the externa environment\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\nThe time-of-flight (TOF) principle is best employed in Magnetic Resonance Angiography.\nTOF angiographic technique is based on the difference between the high signal of blood flowing into an imaging slice and reduced signal from the stationary background tissue.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nFunctional MRI is based on the technique called BOLD i.e., blood oxygen level-dependent technique.\nDuring a particular activity, the corresponding brain area will have increased oxygen consumption. Thus, this type of MRI helps in the detection of functions of different brain parts.\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nThe given image shows Diffusion Tensor Imaging(DTI), an MRI-based neuroimaging.\nIt helps to identify the location, orientation, and anisotropy of the white matter tracts of the brain. White matter tracts of the brain include association fibres, commissural fibres, projection fibres, and subcortical fibres.\nMagnetic Resonance (MR) spectroscopy is a non-invasive test based on the principle of magnetic resonance used to analyse the metabolite distribution within the brain tissue. It contains N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline, creatine, lipids and lactate.\nThe image below shows a normal MR spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nThe given image shows the MR angiography of cerebral circulation. The structure marked is the anterior cerebral artery which is a branch of the internal carotid artery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nThe best plane for measurement of the volume of the hippocampus is the coronal plane, angled perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus in MRI, which is represented by the image marked B.\nCoronal MRI is taken perpendicular to the long axis of the temporal horn can be used to measure:\nVolume of hippocampus - measured in Alzheimer's disease and medial temporal seizures\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA)\nThe planes of MRI are given below.\n\n\nImage marked as D shows the axial section of a CT.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nThe investigation of choice for high-risk screening for DCIS is MRI(most sensitive). The sign of DCIS on MRI is a ductal enhancement. It is done in women of 25-30 years of age.\nMRI breast is usually done in the second week (follicular phase) of the menstrual cycle. This is because the action of progesterone and estrogen in the luteal phase causes the breast stroma to become edematous with the development of the lobules. This shows up as enhancement on imaging although it is physiological.\nMammograms can miss the lesion as young women have dense glandular breast tissue.",
