Insulin induces the movement of intracellular GLUT 4 molecules to the cell surface and thus increases glucose uptake. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, membrane GLUT 4 is reduced, leading to insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 2:\nGlucose transporter specific to the transport of fructose from the intestine to enterocytes is GLUT\n5. It is present in small intestine, testis, and sperm, and it primarily transports fructose.\n\nSolution to Question 3:\nIn the liver, the transport of glucose is through GLUT 2, which is insulin-independent.\nInsulin-stimulated glucose uptake takes place in the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue through GLUT 4.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 4:\nGLUT 1 is the glucose transporter present in erythrocytes.\nIt mediates basal glucose uptake. GLUT 1 is also the major glucose transporter in the brain and placenta and is widely distributed.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 5:\nAdipose tissue will have reduced levels of glucose transporters after overnight fasting.\nThe passive uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue is catalyzed by the GLUT-4 transporter. Levels of insulin-sensitive receptor GLUT-4 decrease after overnight fasting.\nIn the absence of insulin, most GLUT 4 molecules are sequestered in membrane vesicles within the cell, but when blood glucose rises, the release of insulin triggers GLUT 4 movement to the plasma membrane.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 6:\nThe complete breakdown of glucose involves the Krebs cycle (TCA cycle), which occurs in the mitochondria, and not glycolysis.\nGlycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of all cells. 6 carbon-containing glucose is converted to 3 carbon-containing pyruvate in aerobic and lactate in an anaerobic environment. RBC lacks mitochondria and hence completely relies on glucose for energy needs.\nPhosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis and is involved in the conversion of fructose-6-PO4 to fructose 1,6 bisphosphate. This is the\nslowest reaction in glycolysis and is, therefore, the rate-limiting step. Hexokinase, PFK-1, and pyruvate kinase are involved in 3 irreversible steps of glycolysis.\nNet ATP from aerobic glycolysis is 7 ATP. Net ATP from anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP. 2 ATP molecules are utilized in glycolysis. Steps releasing ATP in glycolysis are as follows:\n1,3 bisphosphoglycerate to 3 phosphoglycerate\nPhosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate Inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes:\nIodoacetate inhibits glyceraldehyde 3 PO4 dehydrogenase\n\nFluoride inhibits enolase\nArsenate inhibits 1, 3 bisphosphoglycerate kinase step. Arsenic causes glycolysis to produce zero net ATP.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 7:\nEnolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, which is a reversible step of glycolysis.\nThe irreversible steps of glycolysis are catalyzed by the following enzymes:\nHexokinase\nPhosphofructokinase\nPyruvate kinase\n\n\nSolution to Question 8:\nPhosphofructokinase (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. Citrate inhibits the PFK-1. Mg2+ serves as the co-factor for the enzyme. This step is the committed step of glycolysis.\nIn general, end products of a reaction on accumulation can inhibit the forward direction progress of any reaction. Substrates and cofactors of an enzyme/reaction will stimulate a reaction/to activate the enzyme, and hence push the reaction in the forward direction.\nInhibitors of PFK-1: ATP, Citrate\nAllosteric activators of PFK-1: AMP, ADP, Fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (Most potent activator) Hormonal regulation: Inducer \u2014 Insulin, Repressor\u2014 Glucagon\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 9:\nGlucose is the only cellular substrate that can be phosphorylated by glucokinase.\nGlucokinase has a higher \u2018max and a higher Km value than hexokinase. This means it requires a higher concentration of glucose for half saturation. Hence, glucokinase functions only when the intracellular concentration of glucose is elevated, as seen immediately after a carbohydrate-rich meal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Glucokinase acts on other hexoses such as fructose, mannose too. However, in vivo, the Km for this reaction is so high that at the intracellular concentrations available, the activity is not significant. Hence, the best option has been chosen as the answer in this MC\u0161.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 10:\nFructose 6 phosphate to fructose 1,6 bisphosphate catalyzed by PFK-1 is the first commited step of glycolysis. As fructose 1,6 bisphosphate once formed, it cannot revert back and go into any pathway other than glycolysis.\nNote: Glucose to glucose-6-PO4 is also an irreversible step catalyzed by hexokinase, but as this glucose-6-PO4 can still enter the HMP shunt, it is not a step committed to glycolysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 11:\nLactate dehydrogenase enzyme is needed in anaerobic glycolysis, not pyruvate dehydrogenase.\nUnder anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced to lactate. This reaction is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase.\nSince RBC\u2019s lack mitochondria, the further reactions of pyruvate in the TCA cycle cannot take place. Hence, glycolysis in erythrocytes always ends in the formation of lactate. Also, anaerobic glycolysis is the major fate for pyruvate in the lens and cornea of the eye, kidney medulla, leukocytes, because these are all poorly vascularized structures.\nNet ATP produced per molecule of glucose under anaerobic conditions is 2. The NADH does not contribute to the ATP production because it gets used up in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate, which need NADH.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 12:\nConversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3 biphosphoglycerate catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase involves the addition of inorganic phosphate.\nNote: The step catalyzed by phosphofructokinase utilizes ATP as a phosphate donor and not inorganic phosphate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 13:\nThe enzyme involved in substrate-level phosphorylation is pyruvate kinase.\nIn substrate-level phosphorylation, there is a direct generation of ATP. In glycolysis, there are two such reactions, which are examples of substrate-level phosphorylation. They are as follows:\n1,3 bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase\nPhosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 14:\n\nNet generation of ATP up to pyruvate in aerobic glycolysis is 7. Steps of ATP production in glycolysis:\nBut, remember that 2 molecules of ATP get utilized in the previous steps of glycolysis, catalyzed by the enzymes hexokinase and PFK-1.\nHence, net ATP generation in aerobic glycolysis is 9-2 = 7 ATP.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 15:\nSodium fluoride and potassium oxalate are added to the blood sample to estimate\nglucose. Fluoride is an inhibitor of enolase and hence halts the process of glycolysis. By doing so, it prevents blood glucose levels from being falsely estimated as low.\nInhibitors of glycolytic enzymes:\nFluoride inhibits enolase\nIodoacetate inhibits glyceraldehyde 3 PO4 dehydrogenase\nArsenate inhibits phosphoglycerate kinase\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 16:\nFructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the most potent positive allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 and inhibitor of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase. It is not an intermediate of glycolysis.\nFructose 2, 6-bisphosphate is formed by phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase-2. It acts as an intracellular signal, indicating that glucose is abundant and hence causes an increase in the rate of glycolysis during the well-fed state.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 17:\nDeficiency of pyruvate kinase leads to hemolytic anemia.\n\nErythrocytes lack mitochondria and hence generate ATP exclusively via glycolysis. In a glycolytic enzyme deficiency, there is a reduced rate of glycolysis, leading to decreased ATP production. This results in a few alterations in the RBC membrane, thereby leading to changes in cell shape. Such deformed RBCs are later phagocytosed by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and this results in a state of hemolytic anemia.\nThe most common enzyme deficiency causing hemolytic anemia is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (pentose phosphate pathway).\nThe second most common enzyme deficiency causing hemolytic anemia is the pyruvate kinase. Note: Though hemolysis is seen in PFK-1 deficiency, it does not always manifest as anemia.\n\n\nSolution to Question 18:\nRapaport Leubering cycle (2,3 BPG shunt) occurs in RBCs.\n\n\n\nRapaport Leubering cycle:\n1, 3-Bisphosphoglycerate is converted to 2, 3-bisphosphoglycerate by the action of the enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase. 2, 3-BPG is present at high concentration in RBCs and serves to increase O2 delivery. 2, 3-BPG decreases the O2 affinity of hemoglobin by binding to deoxyhemoglobin and shifts the O2-Hb dissociation curve to the right. Hence, there is more oxygen release in conditions like hypoxia.\n2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is hydrolyzed to 3-phosphoglycerate and Pi by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase and no ATP is generated.\nSince the reaction catalysed by 1, 3- Bisphosphoglycerate kinase is bypassed, no ATPs are produced in that step. Only 2 ATPs are generated by the pyruvate kinase step and 2 ATPs are utilized in the steps catalyzed by hexokinase and PFK-1. Anaerobic glycolysis takes place due to the absence of mitochondria. So this pathway yields no net generation of ATP from glycolysis.\n\nSolution to Question 19:\nCancer cells derive energy mainly from glycolysis.\nCancer cells utilize large amounts of glucose and metabolize it to lactic acid, even in the presence of oxygen. This effect was termed the Warburg effect.\nThe increased rate of glycolysis is due to certain defects in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Besides, this enhanced glycolysis enables the cancer cells to proliferate in the reduced oxygen tension conditions, which is seen in tumors. This switch from aerobic to anaerobic glucose metabolism also acts as an impetus to tumorigenesis.\nThe increased glucose consumption is used as a carbon source for anabolic processes needed to support cell proliferation such as the de novo generation of nucleotides, lipids, and proteins. Also, the major isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase in cancer cells is PK-2 (in contrast to PK-1 in normal cells), which appears to play a role in the Warburg effect.\nNote: This effect is the basis for detecting cancers by FDG-PET scanning.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 20:\nThe liver and kidney are the two major locations where gluconeogenesis takes place.\nDuring short periods of fasting, most gluconeogenesis takes place in the liver, while the remaining takes place in the kidneys. However, during periods of prolonged fasting, the kidneys become a major site of gluconeogenesis.\nGluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose or glycogen from non-carbohydrate precursors. It occurs in cytosol and mitochondria of the liver and kidney. Significant substrates are glucogenic amino acids, lactate, glycerol, and propionate.\nLactate generated in various tissues is transported to the liver and is converted back to pyruvate and enters gluconeogenesis. This pathway is referred to as Cori\u2019s cycle. The Glucose-alanine cycle is referred to as the Cahill cycle.\nMuscle cannot participate in gluconeogenesis since it lacks glucose-6-phosphatase.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 21:\nAcetyl CoA is not a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Instead, it enters the Krebs cycle for oxidative phosphorylation.\nThe following serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis:\nGlucogenic amino acids, alanine being the major contributor (alanine is the source of pyruvate).\nGlucogenic amino acids are converted into pyruvate, oxaloacetate, succinyl CoA, and alpha-ketoglutarate to enter gluconeogenesis and the Krebs cycle at various points.\nLactate\nPyruvate\nGlycero\nPropionate (ruminants)\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 22:\nThe process of reconversion of lactate formed in the muscles and RBCs, back into glucose inside the liver is called Cori's cycle.\nLactic acid is a metabolic byproduct formed after glycolysis in tissues such as the skeletal muscles and RBCs. The lactate so formed is transported into the liver and kidney. Here, it gets reconverted back into glucose. This entire process is called Cori\u2019s cycle or the glucose\u2013lactate cycle.\nCahill cycle is also called as glucose\u2013alanine cycle. In the fasting state, there is a significant output of alanine from skeletal muscle obtained from glycolysis of muscle glycogen. Alanine is derived from the transamination of pyruvate obtained from glycolysis. Alanine is then exported to the liver where it undergoes transamination again back to pyruvate and enters gluconeogenesis.\n\nNote: Pentose phosphate pathway is otherwise known as Warburg-Dickens-Horecker Cycle.\n\n\n\nSolution to Question 23:\nThe liver and muscle are involved in the Cahill cycle.\nDuring periods of fasting, there is the production of alanine in the skeletal muscles, which is formed by transamination reactions from pyruvate. This alanine is shunted out into the circulation, and later on into the liver. Here in the liver, another round of transamination takes place, and the alanine is reconverted back into pyruvate. This pyruvate serves as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. This entire pathway has been called as the Cahill\u2019s cycle or the glucose\u2013alanine pathway.",
